In recitations preceding its operative provisions the Act refers to the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000), which also addressed the subject of abortion procedures used in the later stages of pregnancy. Compared to the state statute at issue in <i>Stenberg,</i> the Act is more specific concerning the instances to which it applies and in this respect more precise in its coverage. We conclude the Act should be sustained against the objections lodged by the broad, facial attack brought against it.</p>\\\\n<p>In No. 05-380 <i>(Carhart)</i> respondents are LeRoy Carhart, William G. Fitzhugh, William H. Knorr, and Jill L. Vibhakar, doctors who perform second-trimester abortions. These doctors filed their complaint against the Attorney General of the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. They challenged the constitutionality of the Act and sought a permanent injunction against its enforcement. <i>Carhart v. Ashcroft,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d 805 (2004). In 2004, after a 2-week trial, the District Court granted a permanent injunction that prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing the Act in all cases but those in which there was no dispute the fetus was viable. <i>Id.,</i> at 1048. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 413 F.3d 791 (2005). We granted certiorari. 546 U.S. 1169, 126 S.Ct. 2901, 165 L.Ed.2d 916 (2006).</p>\\\\n<p>In No. 05-1382 <i>(Planned Parenthood)</i> respondents are Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, and the City and County of San Francisco. The Planned Parenthood entities sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act in a suit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. <i>Planned</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1620</span> <i>Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d 957 (2004). The City and County of San Francisco intervened as a plaintiff. In 2004, the District Court held a trial spanning a period just short of three weeks, and it, too, enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing the Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 1035. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 435 F.3d 1163 (2006). We granted certiorari. 547 U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2901, 165 L.Ed.2d 916 (2006).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act proscribes a particular manner of ending fetal life, so it is necessary here, as it was in <i>Stenberg,</i> to discuss abortion procedures in some detail. Three United States District Courts heard extensive evidence describing the procedures. In addition to the two courts involved in the instant cases the District Court for the Southern District of New York also considered the constitutionality of the Act. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Ashcroft,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d 436 (2004). It found the Act unconstitutional, <i>id.,</i> at 493, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, <i>Nat. Abortion Federation v. Gonzales,</i> 437 F.3d 278 (2006). The three District Courts relied on similar medical evidence; indeed, much of the evidence submitted to the <i>Carhart</i> court previously had been submitted to the other two courts. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 809-810. We refer to the District Courts' exhaustive opinions in our own discussion of abortion procedures.</p>\\\\n<p>Abortion methods vary depending to some extent on the preferences of the physician and, of course, on the term of the pregnancy and the resulting stage of the unborn child's development. Between 85 and 90 percent of the approximately 1.3 million abortions performed each year in the United States take place in the first three months of pregnancy, which is to say in the first trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960, and n. 4; App. in No. 05-1382, pp. 45-48. The most common first-trimester abortion method is vacuum aspiration (otherwise known as suction curettage) in which the physician vacuums out the embryonic tissue. Early in this trimester an alternative is to use medication, such as mifepristone (commonly known as RU-486), to terminate the pregnancy. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464, n. 20. The Act does not regulate these procedures.</p>\\\\n<p>Of the remaining abortions that take place each year, most occur in the second trimester. The surgical procedure referred to as \\\\\\\"dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"D &amp; E\\\\\\\" is the usual abortion method in this trimester. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 960-961. Although individual techniques for performing D &amp; E differ, the general steps are the same.</p>\\\\n<p>A doctor must first dilate the cervix at least to the extent needed to insert surgical instruments into the uterus and to maneuver them to evacuate the fetus. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; App. in No. 05-1382, at 61. The steps taken to cause dilation differ by physician and gestational age of the fetus. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 852, 856, 859, 862-865, 868, 870, 873-874, 876-877, 880, 883, 886. A doctor often begins the dilation process by inserting osmotic dilators, such as laminaria (sticks of seaweed), into the cervix. The dilators can be used in combination with drugs, such as misoprostol, that increase dilation. The resulting amount of dilation is not uniform, and a doctor does not know in advance how an individual patient will respond. In general the longer dilators remain in the cervix, the more it will dilate. Yet the length of time doctors employ osmotic dilators varies. Some may keep dilators in the cervix <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1621</span> for two days, while others use dilators for a day or less. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 464-465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 961.</p>\\\\n<p>After sufficient dilation the surgical operation can commence. The woman is placed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. The doctor, often guided by ultrasound, inserts grasping forceps through the woman's cervix and into the uterus to grab the fetus. The doctor grips a fetal part with the forceps and pulls it back through the cervix and vagina, continuing to pull even after meeting resistance from the cervix. The friction causes the fetus to tear apart. For example, a leg might be ripped off the fetus as it is pulled through the cervix and out of the woman. The process of evacuating the fetus piece by piece continues until it has been completely removed. A doctor may make 10 to 15 passes with the forceps to evacuate the fetus in its entirety, though sometimes removal is completed with fewer passes. Once the fetus has been evacuated, the placenta and any remaining fetal material are suctioned or scraped out of the uterus. The doctor examines the different parts to ensure the entire fetal body has been removed. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 465; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962.</p>\\\\n<p>Some doctors, especially later in the second trimester, may kill the fetus a day or two before performing the surgical evacuation. They inject digoxin or potassium chloride into the fetus, the umbilical cord, or the amniotic fluid. Fetal demise may cause contractions and make greater dilation possible. Once dead, moreover, the fetus' body will soften, and its removal will be easier. Other doctors refrain from injecting chemical agents, believing it adds risk with little or no medical benefit. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 907-912; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 474-475.</p>\\\\n<p>The abortion procedure that was the impetus for the numerous bans on \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion,\\\\\\\" including the Act, is a variation of this standard D &amp; E. See M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), 1 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 109 (hereinafter Dilation and Extraction). The medical community has not reached unanimity on the appropriate name for this D &amp; E variation. It has been referred to as \\\\\\\"intact D &amp; E,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" (D &amp; X), and \\\\\\\"intact D &amp; X.\\\\\\\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 440, n. 2; see also F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 243 (22d ed.2005) (identifying the procedure as D &amp; X); Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology 567 (J. Scott, R. Gibbs, B. Karlan, &amp; A. Haney eds. 9th ed.2003) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; X); M. Paul, E. Lichtenberg, L. Borgatta, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Stubblefield, A Clinician's Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 136 (1999) (identifying the procedure as intact D &amp; E). For discussion purposes this D &amp; E variation will be referred to as intact D &amp; E. The main difference between the two procedures is that in intact D &amp; E a doctor extracts the fetus intact or largely intact with only a few passes. There are no comprehensive statistics indicating what percentage of all D &amp; Es are performed in this manner.</p>\\\\n<p>Intact D &amp; E, like regular D &amp; E, begins with dilation of the cervix. Sufficient dilation is essential for the procedure. To achieve intact extraction some doctors thus may attempt to dilate the cervix to a greater degree. This approach has been called \\\\\\\"serial\\\\\\\" dilation. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 856, 870, 873; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965. Doctors who attempt at the outset to perform intact D &amp; E may dilate for two full days or use up to 25 osmotic dilators. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110; <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 865, 868, 876, 886.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1622</span> In an intact D &amp; E procedure the doctor extracts the fetus in a way conducive to pulling out its entire body, instead of ripping it apart. One doctor, for example, testified:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"If I know I have good dilation and I reach in and the fetus starts to come out and I think I can accomplish it, the abortion with an intact delivery, then I use my forceps a little bit differently. I don't close them quite so much, and I just gently draw the tissue out attempting to have an intact delivery, if possible.\\\\\\\" App. in No. 05-1382, at 74.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Rotating the fetus as it is being pulled decreases the odds of dismemberment. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 868-869; App. in No. 05-380, pp. 40-41; 5 Appellant's App. in No. 04-3379(CA8), p. 1469. A doctor also \\\\\\\"may use forceps to grasp a fetal part, pull it down, and re-grasp the fetus at a higher level\\u00c2\\u2014sometimes using both his hand and a forceps\\u00c2\\u2014to exert traction to retrieve the fetus intact until the head is lodged in the [cervix].\\\\\\\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 886-887.</p>\\\\n<p>Intact D &amp; E gained public notoriety when, in 1992, Dr. Martin Haskell gave a presentation describing his method of performing the operation. Dilation and Extraction 110-111. In the usual intact D &amp; E the fetus' head lodges in the cervix, and dilation is insufficient to allow it to pass. See, <i>e.g., ibid.;</i> App. in No. 05-380, at 577; App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 282. Haskell explained the next step as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left [hand] along the back of the fetus and \\\\\\\"hooks\\\\\\\" the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`While maintaining this tension, lifting the cervix and applying traction to the shoulders with the fingers of the left hand, the surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.'\\\\\\\" H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, p. 3 (2003).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>This is an abortion doctor's clinical description. Here is another description from a nurse who witnessed the same method performed on a 26\\u00c2\\u00bd-week fetus and who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby's body and the arms\\u00c2\\u2014everything but the head. The doctor kept the head right inside the uterus. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"`He cut the umbilical cord and delivered the placenta. He threw the baby <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1623</span> in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Dr. Haskell's approach is not the only method of killing the fetus once its head lodges in the cervix, and \\\\\\\"the process has evolved\\\\\\\" since his presentation. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965. Another doctor, for example, squeezes the skull after it has been pierced \\\\\\\"so that enough brain tissue exudes to allow the head to pass through.\\\\\\\" App. in No. 05-380, at 41; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866-867, 874. Still other physicians reach into the cervix with their forceps and crush the fetus' skull. <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858, 881. Others continue to pull the fetus out of the woman until it disarticulates at the neck, in effect decapitating it. These doctors then grasp the head with forceps, crush it, and remove it. <i>Id.,</i> at 864, 878; see also <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 965.</p>\\\\n<p>Some doctors performing an intact D &amp; E attempt to remove the fetus without collapsing the skull. See <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 866, 869. Yet one doctor would not allow delivery of a live fetus younger than 24 weeks because \\\\\\\"the objective of [his] procedure is to perform an abortion,\\\\\\\" not a birth. App. in No. 05-1382, at 408-409. The doctor thus answered in the affirmative when asked whether he would \\\\\\\"hold the fetus' head on the internal side of the [cervix] in order to collapse the skull\\\\\\\" and kill the fetus before it is born. <i>Id.,</i> at 409; see also <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 862, 878. Another doctor testified he crushes a fetus' skull not only to reduce its size but also to ensure the fetus is dead before it is removed. For the staff to have to deal with a fetus that has \\\\\\\"some viability to it, some movement of limbs,\\\\\\\" according to this doctor, \\\\\\\"[is] always a difficult situation.\\\\\\\" App. in No. 05-380, at 94; see <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 858.</p>\\\\n<p>D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E are not the only second-trimester abortion methods. Doctors also may abort a fetus through medical induction. The doctor medicates the woman to induce labor, and contractions occur to deliver the fetus. Induction, which unlike D &amp; E should occur in a hospital, can last as little as 6 hours but can take longer than 48. It accounts for about five percent of second-trimester abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and 15 percent of those after 20 weeks. Doctors turn to two other methods of second-trimester abortion, hysterotomy and hysterectomy, only in emergency situations because they carry increased risk of complications. In a hysterotomy, as in a cesarean section, the doctor removes the fetus by making an incision through the abdomen and uterine wall to gain access to the uterine cavity. A hysterectomy requires the removal of the entire uterus. These two procedures represent about .07% of second-trimester abortions. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 467; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 962-963.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>After Dr. Haskell's procedure received public attention, with ensuing and increasing public concern, bans on \\\\\\\"`partial birth abortion'\\\\\\\" proliferated. By the time of the <i>Stenberg</i> decision, about 30 States had enacted bans designed to prohibit the procedure. 530 U.S., at 995-996, and nn. 12-13, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); see also H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 4-5. In 1996, Congress also acted to ban partial-birth abortion. President Clinton vetoed the congressional legislation, and the Senate failed to override the veto. Congress approved another bill banning the procedure in 1997, but President Clinton again vetoed it. In 2003, after this Court's decision in <i>Stenberg,</i> Congress passed the Act at issue here. H.R.Rep. No. 108-58, at 12-14. On November 5, 2003, President <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1624</span> Bush signed the Act into law. It was to take effect the following day. 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\\\\n<p>The Act responded to <i>Stenberg</i> in two ways. First, Congress made factual findings. Congress determined that this Court in <i>Stenberg</i> \\\\\\\"was required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 2(7), 117 Stat. 1202, notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 768, \\u00c2\\u00b6 (7) (Congressional Findings), but that Congress was \\\\\\\"not bound to accept the same factual findings,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.,</i> \\u00c2\\u00b6 (8). Congress found, among other things, that \\\\\\\"[a] moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion . . . is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 767, \\u00c2\\u00b6 (1).</p>\\\\n<p>Second, and more relevant here, the Act's language differs from that of the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 921-922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1), 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The operative provisions of the Act provide in relevant part:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(a) Any physician who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly performs a partial-birth abortion and thereby kills a human fetus shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both. This subsection does not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This subsection takes effect 1 day after the enactment.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(b) As used in this section\\u00c2\\u2014</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(1) the term `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion\\u00c2\\u2014</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus; and</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(2) the term `physician' means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice medicine and surgery by the State in which the doctor performs such activity, or any other individual legally authorized by the State to perform abortions: <i>Provided, however,</i> That any individual who is not a physician or not otherwise legally authorized by the State to perform abortions, but who nevertheless directly performs a partial-birth abortion, shall be subject to the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(d)(1) A defendant accused of an offense under this section may seek a hearing before the State Medical Board on whether the physician's conduct was necessary to save the life of the mother whose life was endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(2) The findings on that issue are admissible on that issue at the trial of the defendant. Upon a motion of the defendant, the court shall delay the beginning <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1625</span> of the trial for not more than 30 days to permit such a hearing to take place.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(e) A woman upon whom a partial-birth abortion is performed may not be prosecuted under this section, for a conspiracy to violate this section, or for an offense under section 2, 3, or 4 of this title based on a violation of this section.\\\\\\\" 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The Act also includes a provision authorizing civil actions that is not of relevance here. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(c).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>The District Court in <i>Carhart</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional for two reasons. First, it determined the Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception allowing the procedure where necessary for the health of the mother. 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1004-1030. Second, the District Court found the Act deficient because it covered not merely intact D &amp; E but also certain other D &amp; Es. <i>Id.,</i> at 1030-1037.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed only the lack of a health exception. 413 F.3d, at 803-804. The court began its analysis with what it saw as the appropriate question\\u00c2\\u2014\\\\\\\"whether `substantial medical authority' supports the medical necessity of the banned procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 796 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597). This was the proper framework, according to the Court of Appeals, because \\\\\\\"when a lack of consensus exists in the medical community, the Constitution requires legislatures to err on the side of protecting women's health by including a health exception.\\\\\\\" 413 F.3d, at 796. The court rejected the Attorney General's attempt to demonstrate changed evidentiary circumstances since <i>Stenberg</i> and considered itself bound by <i>Stenberg's</i> conclusion that a health exception was required. 413 F.3d, at 803 (explaining \\\\\\\"[t]he record in [the] case and the record in <i>Stenberg</i> [were] similar in all significant respects\\\\\\\"). It invalidated the Act. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>D</h2>\\\\n<p>The District Court in <i>Planned Parenthood</i> concluded the Act was unconstitutional \\\\\\\"because it (1) pose[d] an undue burden on a woman's ability to choose a second trimester abortion; (2)[was] unconstitutionally vague; and (3) require[d] a health exception as set forth by . . . <i>Stenberg.</i>\\\\\\\" 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034-1035.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. Like the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, it concluded the absence of a health exception rendered the Act unconstitutional. The court interpreted <i>Stenberg</i> to require a health exception unless \\\\\\\"there is <i>consensus in the medical community</i> that the banned procedure is never medically necessary to preserve the health of women.\\\\\\\" 435 F.3d, at 1173. Even after applying a deferential standard of review to Congress' factual findings, the Court of Appeals determined \\\\\\\"substantial disagreement exists in the medical community regarding whether\\\\\\\" the procedures prohibited by the Act are ever necessary to preserve a woman's health. <i>Id.,</i> at 1175-1176.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded further that the Act placed an undue burden on a woman's ability to obtain a second-trimester abortion. The court found the textual differences between the Act and the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> insufficient to distinguish D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E. 435 F.3d, at 1178-1180. As a result, according to the Court of Appeals, the Act imposed an undue burden because it prohibited D &amp; E. <i>Id.,</i> at 1180-1181.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, the Court of Appeals found the Act void for vagueness. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181. Abortion doctors testified they were uncertain <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1626</span> which procedures the Act made criminal. The court thus concluded the Act did not offer physicians clear warning of its regulatory reach. <i>Id.,</i> at 1181-1184. Resting on its understanding of the remedial framework established by this Court in <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 328-330, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006), the Court of Appeals held the Act was unconstitutional on its face and should be permanently enjoined. 435 F.3d, at 1184-1191.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The principles set forth in the joint opinion in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), did not find support from all those who join the instant opinion. See <i>id.,</i> at 979-1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., <i>inter alios,</i> concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Whatever one's views concerning the <i>Casey</i> joint opinion, it is evident a premise central to its conclusion\\u00c2\\u2014that the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\\u00c2\\u2014would be repudiated were the Court now to affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Casey</i> involved a challenge to <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). The opinion contains this summary:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <i>Roe's</i> essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Though all three holdings are implicated in the instant cases, it is the third that requires the most extended discussion; for we must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.</p>\\\\n<p>To implement its holding, <i>Casey</i> rejected both <i>Roe's</i> rigid trimester framework and the interpretation of <i>Roe</i> that considered all previability regulations of abortion unwarranted. 505 U.S., at 875-876, 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). On this point <i>Casey</i> overruled the holdings in two cases because they undervalued the State's interest in potential life. See <i>id.,</i> at 881-883, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion) (overruling <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) and <i>Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983)).</p>\\\\n<p>We assume the following principles for the purposes of this opinion. Before viability, a State \\\\\\\"may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). It also may not impose upon this right an undue burden, which exists if a regulation's \\\\\\\"purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1627</span> seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791. On the other hand, \\\\\\\"[r]egulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 877, 112 S.Ct. 2791. <i>Casey,</i> in short, struck a balance. The balance was central to its holding. We now apply its standard to the cases at bar.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>We begin with a determination of the Act's operation and effect. A straightforward reading of the Act's text demonstrates its purpose and the scope of its provisions: It regulates and proscribes, with exceptions or qualifications to be discussed, performing the intact D &amp; E procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>Respondents agree the Act encompasses intact D &amp; E, but they contend its additional reach is both unclear and excessive. Respondents assert that, at the least, the Act is void for vagueness because its scope is indefinite. In the alternative, respondents argue the Act's text proscribes all D &amp; Es. Because D &amp; E is the most common second-trimester abortion method, respondents suggest the Act imposes an undue burden. In this litigation the Attorney General does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E.</p>\\\\n<p>We conclude that the Act is not void for vagueness, does not impose an undue burden from any overbreadth, and is not invalid on its face.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act punishes \\\\\\\"knowingly perform[ing]\\\\\\\" a \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). It defines the unlawful abortion in explicit terms. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1).</p>\\\\n<p>First, the person performing the abortion must \\\\\\\"vaginally delive[r] a living fetus.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). The Act does not restrict an abortion procedure involving the delivery of an expired fetus. The Act, furthermore, is inapplicable to abortions that do not involve vaginal delivery (for instance, hysterotomy or hysterectomy). The Act does apply both previability and postviability because, by common understanding and scientific terminology, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb, whether or not it is viable outside the womb. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 971-972. We do not understand this point to be contested by the parties.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, the Act's definition of partial-birth abortion requires the fetus to be delivered \\\\\\\"until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that if an abortion procedure does not involve the delivery of a living fetus to one of these \\\\\\\"anatomical `landmarks'\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014where, depending on the presentation, either the fetal head or the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother\\u00c2\\u2014the prohibitions of the Act do not apply. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, p. 46.</p>\\\\n<p>Third, to fall within the Act, a doctor must perform an \\\\\\\"overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). For purposes of criminal liability, the overt act causing the fetus' death must be separate from delivery. And the overt act must <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1628</span> occur after the delivery to an anatomical landmark. This is because the Act proscribes killing \\\\\\\"the partially delivered\\\\\\\" fetus, which, when read in context, refers to a fetus that has been delivered to an anatomical landmark. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>Fourth, the Act contains scienter requirements concerning all the actions involved in the prohibited abortion. To begin with, the physician must have \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally\\\\\\\" delivered the fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). If a living fetus is delivered past the critical point by accident or inadvertence, the Act is inapplicable. In addition, the fetus must have been delivered \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing an overt act that the [doctor] knows will kill [it].\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> If either intent is absent, no crime has occurred. This follows from the general principle that where scienter is required no crime is committed absent the requisite state of mind. See generally 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \\u00c2\\u00a7 5.1 (2d ed.2003) (hereinafter LaFave); 1 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law \\u00c2\\u00a7 27 (15th ed.1993).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Respondents contend the language described above is indeterminate, and they thus argue the Act is unconstitutionally vague on its face. \\\\\\\"As generally stated, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\\\\\\\" <i>Kolender v. Lawson,</i> 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); <i>Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 513, 525, 114 S.Ct. 1747, 128 L.Ed.2d 539 (1994). The Act satisfies both requirements.</p>\\\\n<p>The Act provides doctors \\\\\\\"of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited.\\\\\\\" <i>Grayned v. City of Rockford,</i> 408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Indeed, it sets forth \\\\\\\"relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited conduct\\\\\\\" and provides \\\\\\\"objective criteria\\\\\\\" to evaluate whether a doctor has performed a prohibited procedure. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 525-526, 114 S.Ct. 1747. Unlike the statutory language in <i>Stenberg</i> that prohibited the delivery of a \\\\\\\"`substantial portion'\\\\\\\" of the fetus\\u00c2\\u2014 where a doctor might question how much of the fetus is a substantial portion\\u00c2\\u2014the Act defines the line between potentially criminal conduct on the one hand and lawful abortion on the other. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). Doctors performing D &amp; E will know that if they do not deliver a living fetus to an anatomical landmark they will not face criminal liability.</p>\\\\n<p>This conclusion is buttressed by the intent that must be proved to impose liability. The Court has made clear that scienter requirements alleviate vagueness concerns. <i>Posters `N' Things, supra,</i> at 526, 114 S.Ct. 1747; see also <i>Colautti v. Franklin,</i> 439 U.S. 379, 395, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979) (\\\\\\\"This Court has long recognized that the constitutionality of a vague statutory standard is closely related to whether that standard incorporates a requirement of <i>mens rea</i>\\\\\\\"). The Act requires the doctor deliberately to have delivered the fetus to an anatomical landmark. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Because a doctor performing a D &amp; E will not face criminal liability if he or she delivers a fetus beyond the prohibited point by mistake, the Act cannot be described as \\\\\\\"a trap for those who act in good faith.\\\\\\\" <i>Colautti, supra,</i> at 395, 99 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1629</span> S.Ct. 675 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>Respondents likewise have failed to show that the Act should be invalidated on its face because it encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855. Just as the Act's anatomical landmarks provide doctors with objective standards, they also \\\\\\\"establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.\\\\\\\" <i>Smith v. Goguen,</i> 415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). The scienter requirements narrow the scope of the Act's prohibition and limit prosecutorial discretion. It cannot be said that the Act \\\\\\\"vests virtually complete discretion in the hands of [law enforcement] to determine whether the [doctor] has satisfied [its provisions].\\\\\\\" <i>Kolender, supra,</i> at 358, 103 S.Ct. 1855 (invalidating a statute regulating loitering). Respondents' arguments concerning arbitrary enforcement, furthermore, are somewhat speculative. This is a preenforcement challenge, where \\\\\\\"no evidence has been, or could be, introduced to indicate whether the [Act] has been enforced in a discriminatory manner or with the aim of inhibiting [constitutionally protected conduct].\\\\\\\" <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 503, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). The Act is not vague.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>We next determine whether the Act imposes an undue burden, as a facial matter, because its restrictions on second-trimester abortions are too broad. A review of the statutory text discloses the limits of its reach. The Act prohibits intact D &amp; E; and, notwithstanding respondents' arguments, it does not prohibit the D &amp; E procedure in which the fetus is removed in parts.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act prohibits a doctor from intentionally performing an intact D &amp; E. The dual prohibitions of the Act, both of which are necessary for criminal liability, correspond with the steps generally undertaken during this type of procedure. First, a doctor delivers the fetus until its head lodges in the cervix, which is usually past the anatomical landmark for a breech presentation. See 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). Second, the doctor proceeds to pierce the fetal skull with scissors or crush it with forceps. This step satisfies the overt-act requirement because it kills the fetus and is distinct from delivery. See \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). The Act's intent requirements, however, limit its reach to those physicians who carry out the intact D &amp; E after intending to undertake both steps at the outset.</p>\\\\n<p>The Act excludes most D &amp; Es in which the fetus is removed in pieces, not intact. If the doctor intends to remove the fetus in parts from the outset, the doctor will not have the requisite intent to incur criminal liability. A doctor performing a standard D &amp; E procedure can often \\\\\\\"tak[e] about 10-15 `passes' through the uterus to remove the entire fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 962. Removing the fetus in this manner does not violate the Act because the doctor will not have delivered the living fetus to one of the anatomical landmarks or committed an additional overt act that kills the fetus after partial delivery. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\\\\n<p>A comparison of the Act with the Nebraska statute struck down in <i>Stenberg</i> confirms this point. The statute in <i>Stenberg</i> prohibited \\\\\\\"`deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1630</span> procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.'\\\\\\\" 530 U.S., at 922, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Court concluded that this statute encompassed D &amp; E because \\\\\\\"D &amp; E will often involve a physician pulling a `substantial portion' of a still living fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus.\\\\\\\" 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Court also rejected the limiting interpretation urged by Nebraska's Attorney General that the statute's reference to a \\\\\\\"procedure\\\\\\\" that \\\\\\\"`kill[s] the unborn child'\\\\\\\" was to a distinct procedure, not to the abortion procedure as a whole. <i>Id.,</i> at 943, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\\\\n<p>Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in <i>Stenberg.</i> It adopts the phrase \\\\\\\"delivers a living fetus,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), instead of \\\\\\\"`delivering . . . a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,'\\\\\\\" 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (quoting Neb.Rev.Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999)). The Act's language, unlike the statute in <i>Stenberg,</i> expresses the usual meaning of \\\\\\\"deliver\\\\\\\" when used in connection with \\\\\\\"fetus,\\\\\\\" namely, extraction of an entire fetus rather than removal of fetal pieces. See Stedman's Medical Dictionary 470 (27th ed.2000) (defining deliver as \\\\\\\"[t]o assist a woman in childbirth\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"[t]o extract from an enclosed place, as the fetus from the womb, an object or foreign body\\\\\\\"); see also I. Dox, B. Melloni, G. Eisner, &amp; J. Melloni, The HarperCollins Illustrated Medical Dictionary 160 (4th ed.2001); Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 306 (10th ed.1997). The Act thus displaces the interpretation of \\\\\\\"delivering\\\\\\\" dictated by the Nebraska statute's reference to a \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" of the fetus. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 944, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (indicating that the Nebraska \\\\\\\"statute itself specifies that it applies <i>both</i> to delivering `an intact unborn child' <i>or</i> `a substantial portion thereof'\\\\\\\"). In interpreting statutory texts courts use the ordinary meaning of terms unless context requires a different result. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \\u00c2\\u00a7 47:28 (rev. 6th ed.2000). Here, unlike in <i>Stenberg,</i> the language does not require a departure from the ordinary meaning. D &amp; E does not involve the delivery of a fetus because it requires the removal of fetal parts that are ripped from the fetus as they are pulled through the cervix.</p>\\\\n<p>The identification of specific anatomical landmarks to which the fetus must be partially delivered also differentiates the Act from the statute at issue in <i>Stenberg.</i> \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). The Court in <i>Stenberg</i> interpreted \\\\\\\"`substantial portion'\\\\\\\" of the fetus to include an arm or a leg. 530 U.S., at 939, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The Act's anatomical landmarks, by contrast, clarify that the removal of a small portion of the fetus is not prohibited. The landmarks also require the fetus to be delivered so that it is partially \\\\\\\"outside the body of the mother.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A). To come within the ambit of the Nebraska statute, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the fetus only had to be delivered into the vagina; no part of the fetus had to be outside the body of the mother before a doctor could face criminal sanctions. <i>Id.,</i> at 938-939, 120 S.Ct. 2597.</p>\\\\n<p>By adding an overt-act requirement Congress sought further to meet the Court's objections to the state statute considered in <i>Stenberg.</i> Compare 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) with Neb. Rev.Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp.1999). The Act makes the distinction the Nebraska statute failed to draw (but the Nebraska Attorney General advanced) by differentiating between the overall partial-birth <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1631</span> abortion and the distinct overt act that kills the fetus. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 943-944, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The fatal overt act must occur after delivery to an anatomical landmark, and it must be something \\\\\\\"other than [the] completion of delivery.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(B). This distinction matters because, unlike intact D &amp; E, standard D &amp; E does not involve a delivery followed by a fatal act.</p>\\\\n<p>The canon of constitutional avoidance, finally, extinguishes any lingering doubt as to whether the Act covers the prototypical D &amp; E procedure. \\\\\\\"`[T]he elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.'\\\\\\\" <i>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</i> 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988) (quoting <i>Hooper v. California,</i> 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895)). It is true this longstanding maxim of statutory interpretation has, in the past, fallen by the wayside when the Court confronted a statute regulating abortion. The Court at times employed an antagonistic \\\\\\\"`canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute [was] to be avoided at all costs.'\\\\\\\" <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U.S., at 829, 106 S.Ct. 2169 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). <i>Casey</i> put this novel statutory approach to rest. <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 977, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). <i>Stenberg</i> need not be interpreted to have revived it. We read that decision instead to stand for the uncontroversial proposition that the canon of constitutional avoidance does not apply if a statute is not \\\\\\\"genuinely susceptible to two constructions.\\\\\\\" <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 238, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); see also <i>Clark v. Martinez,</i> 543 U.S. 371, 385, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734 (2005). In <i>Stenberg</i> the Court found the statute covered D &amp; E. 530 U.S., at 938-945, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Here, by contrast, interpreting the Act so that it does not prohibit standard D &amp; E is the most reasonable reading and understanding of its terms.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>2</h2>\\\\n<p>Contrary arguments by the respondents are unavailing. Respondents look to situations that might arise during D &amp; E, situations not examined in <i>Stenberg.</i> They contend\\u00c2\\u2014relying on the testimony of numerous abortion doctors\\u00c2\\u2014that D &amp; E may result in the delivery of a living fetus beyond the Act's anatomical landmarks in a significant fraction of cases. This is so, respondents say, because doctors cannot predict the amount the cervix will dilate before the abortion procedure. It might dilate to a degree that the fetus will be removed largely intact. To complete the abortion, doctors will commit an overt act that kills the partially delivered fetus. Respondents thus posit that any D &amp; E has the potential to violate the Act, and that a physician will not know beforehand whether the abortion will proceed in a prohibited manner. Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, p. 38.</p>\\\\n<p>This reasoning, however, does not take account of the Act's intent requirements, which preclude liability from attaching to an accidental intact D &amp; E. If a doctor's intent at the outset is to perform a D &amp; E in which the fetus would not be delivered to either of the Act's anatomical landmarks, but the fetus nonetheless is delivered past one of those points, the requisite and prohibited scienter is not present. 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). When a doctor in that situation completes an abortion by performing an intact <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1632</span> D &amp; E, the doctor does not violate the Act. It is true that intent to cause a result may sometimes be inferred if a person \\\\\\\"knows that that result is practically certain to follow from his conduct.\\\\\\\" 1 LaFave \\u00c2\\u00a7 5.2(a), at 341. Yet abortion doctors intending at the outset to perform a standard D &amp; E procedure will not know that a prohibited abortion \\\\\\\"is practically certain to follow from\\\\\\\" their conduct. <i>Ibid.</i> A fetus is only delivered largely intact in a small fraction of the overall number of D &amp; E abortions. <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 965.</p>\\\\n<p>The evidence also supports a legislative determination that an intact delivery is almost always a conscious choice rather than a happenstance. Doctors, for example, may remove the fetus in a manner that will increase the chances of an intact delivery. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-1382, at 74, 452. And intact D &amp; E is usually described as involving some manner of serial dilation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dilation and Extraction 110. Doctors who do not seek to obtain this serial dilation perform an intact D &amp; E on far fewer occasions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 857-858 (\\\\\\\"In order for intact removal to occur on a regular basis, Dr. Fitzhugh would have to dilate his patients with a second round of laminaria\\\\\\\"). This evidence belies any claim that a standard D &amp; E cannot be performed without intending or foreseeing an intact D &amp; E.</p>\\\\n<p>Many doctors who testified on behalf of respondents, and who objected to the Act, do not perform an intact D &amp; E by accident. On the contrary, they begin every D &amp; E abortion with the objective of removing the fetus as intact as possible. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 869 (\\\\\\\"Since Dr. Chasen believes that the intact D &amp; E is safer than the dismemberment D &amp; E, Dr. Chasen's goal is to perform an intact D &amp; E every time\\\\\\\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 873, 886. This does not prove, as respondents suggest, that every D &amp; E might violate the Act and that the Act therefore imposes an undue burden. It demonstrates only that those doctors who intend to perform a D &amp; E that would involve delivery of a living fetus to one of the Act's anatomical landmarks must adjust their conduct to the law by not attempting to deliver the fetus to either of those points. Respondents have not shown that requiring doctors to intend dismemberment before delivery to an anatomical landmark will prohibit the vast majority of D &amp; E abortions. The Act, then, cannot be held invalid on its face on these grounds.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>Under the principles accepted as controlling here, the Act, as we have interpreted it, would be unconstitutional \\\\\\\"if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\\\\\\\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). The abortions affected by the Act's regulations take place both previability and postviability; so the quoted language and the undue burden analysis it relies upon are applicable. The question is whether the Act, measured by its text in this facial attack, imposes a substantial obstacle to late-term, but previability, abortions. The Act does not on its face impose a substantial obstacle, and we reject this further facial challenge to its validity.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act's purposes are set forth in recitals preceding its operative provisions. A description of the prohibited abortion procedure demonstrates the rationale for the congressional enactment. The Act proscribes a method of abortion in which a fetus is killed just inches before <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1633</span> completion of the birth process. Congress stated as follows: \\\\\\\"Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life.\\\\\\\" Congressional Findings (14)(N), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life.</p>\\\\n<p>Congress was concerned, furthermore, with the effects on the medical community and on its reputation caused by the practice of partial-birth abortion. The findings in the Act explain:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Partial-birth abortion . . . confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life.\\\\\\\" Congressional Findings (14)(J), <i>ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>There can be no doubt the government \\\\\\\"has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\\\\\\\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 731, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997); see also <i>Barsky v. Board of Regents of Univ. of N. Y.,</i> 347 U.S. 442, 451, 74 S.Ct. 650, 98 L.Ed. 829 (1954) (indicating the State has \\\\\\\"legitimate concern for maintaining high standards of professional conduct\\\\\\\" in the practice of medicine). Under our precedents it is clear the State has a significant role to play in regulating the medical profession.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Casey</i> reaffirmed these governmental objectives. The government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman. A central premise of the opinion was that the Court's precedents after <i>Roe</i> had \\\\\\\"undervalue[d] the State's interest in potential life.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion); see also <i>id.,</i> at 871, 112 S.Ct. 2791. The plurality opinion indicated \\\\\\\"[t]he fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 112 S.Ct. 2791. This was not an idle assertion. The three premises of <i>Casey</i> must coexist. See <i>id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). The third premise, that the State, from the inception of the pregnancy, maintains its own regulatory interest in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child, cannot be set at naught by interpreting <i>Casey's</i> requirement of a health exception so it becomes tantamount to allowing a doctor to choose the abortion method he or she might prefer. Where it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power to bar certain procedures and substitute others, all in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.</p>\\\\n<p>The Act's ban on abortions that involve partial delivery of a living fetus furthers the Government's objectives. No one would dispute that, for many, D &amp; E is a procedure itself laden with the power to devalue human life. Congress could nonetheless conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition. Congress determined that the abortion methods it proscribed had a \\\\\\\"disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant,\\\\\\\" Congressional Findings (14)(L), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769, and thus it was concerned with \\\\\\\"draw[ing] a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1634</span> bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide.\\\\\\\" Congressional Findings (14)(G), <i>ibid.</i> The Court has in the past confirmed the validity of drawing boundaries to prevent certain practices that extinguish life and are close to actions that are condemned. <i>Glucksberg</i> found reasonable the State's \\\\\\\"fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps even involuntary euthanasia.\\\\\\\" 521 U.S., at 732-735, and n. 23, 117 S.Ct. 2258.</p>\\\\n<p>Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child. The Act recognizes this reality as well. Whether to have an abortion requires a difficult and painful moral decision. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 852-853, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. See Brief for Sandra Cano et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in No. 05-380, pp. 22-24. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>In a decision so fraught with emotional consequence some doctors may prefer not to disclose precise details of the means that will be used, confining themselves to the required statement of risks the procedure entails. From one standpoint this ought not to be surprising. Any number of patients facing imminent surgical procedures would prefer not to hear all details, lest the usual anxiety preceding invasive medical procedures become the more intense. This is likely the case with the abortion procedures here in issue. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 466, n. 22 (\\\\\\\"Most of [the plaintiffs'] experts acknowledged that they do not describe to their patients what [the D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E] procedures entail in clear and precise terms\\\\\\\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 479.</p>\\\\n<p>It is, however, precisely this lack of information concerning the way in which the fetus will be killed that is of legitimate concern to the State. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion) (\\\\\\\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning\\\\\\\"). The State has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her unborn child, a child assuming the human form.</p>\\\\n<p>It is a reasonable inference that a necessary effect of the regulation and the knowledge it conveys will be to encourage some women to carry the infant to full term, thus reducing the absolute number of late-term abortions. The medical profession, furthermore, may find different and less shocking methods to abort the fetus in the second trimester, thereby accommodating legislative demand. The State's interest in respect for life is advanced by the dialogue that better informs the political and legal systems, the medical profession, expectant mothers, and society as a whole of the consequences that follow from a decision to elect a late-term abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>It is objected that the standard D &amp; E is in some respects as brutal, if not more, than the intact D &amp; E, so that the legislation accomplishes little. What we have already said, however, shows ample justification for the regulation. Partial-birth abortion, as defined by the Act, differs from a standard D &amp; E because the former <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1635</span> occurs when the fetus is partially outside the mother to the point of one of the Act's anatomical landmarks. It was reasonable for Congress to think that partial-birth abortion, more than standard D &amp; E, \\\\\\\"undermines the public's perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world.\\\\\\\" Congressional Findings (14)(K), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. There would be a flaw in this Court's logic, and an irony in its jurisprudence, were we first to conclude a ban on both D &amp; E and intact D &amp; E was overbroad and then to say it is irrational to ban only intact D &amp; E because that does not proscribe both procedures. In sum, we reject the contention that the congressional purpose of the Act was \\\\\\\"to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 878, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act's furtherance of legitimate government interests bears upon, but does not resolve, the next question: whether the Act has the effect of imposing an unconstitutional burden on the abortion right because it does not allow use of the barred procedure where \\\\\\\"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for [the] preservation of the . . . health of the mother.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (quoting <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion)). The prohibition in the Act would be unconstitutional, under precedents we here assume to be controlling, if it \\\\\\\"subject[ed] [women] to significant health risks.\\\\\\\" <i>Ayotte, supra,</i> at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961; see also <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 880, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). In <i>Ayotte</i> the parties agreed a health exception to the challenged parental-involvement statute was necessary \\\\\\\"to avert serious and often irreversible damage to [a pregnant minor's] health.\\\\\\\" 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961. Here, by contrast, whether the Act creates significant health risks for women has been a contested factual question. The evidence presented in the trial courts and before Congress demonstrates both sides have medical support for their position.</p>\\\\n<p>Respondents presented evidence that intact D &amp; E may be the safest method of abortion, for reasons similar to those adduced in <i>Stenberg.</i> See 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597. Abortion doctors testified, for example, that intact D &amp; E decreases the risk of cervical laceration or uterine perforation because it requires fewer passes into the uterus with surgical instruments and does not require the removal of bony fragments of the dismembered fetus, fragments that may be sharp. Respondents also presented evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer both because it reduces the risks that fetal parts will remain in the uterus and because it takes less time to complete. Respondents, in addition, proffered evidence that intact D &amp; E was safer for women with certain medical conditions or women with fetuses that had certain anomalies. See, <i>e.g., Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-929; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 982-983.</p>\\\\n<p>These contentions were contradicted by other doctors who testified in the District Courts and before Congress. They concluded that the alleged health advantages were based on speculation without scientific studies to support them. They considered D &amp; E always to be a safe alternative. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 930-940; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 470-474; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 983.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1636</span> There is documented medical disagreement whether the Act's prohibition would ever impose significant health risks on women. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 1033 (\\\\\\\"[T]here continues to be a division of opinion among highly qualified experts regarding the necessity or safety of intact D &amp; E\\\\\\\"); see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 482. The three District Courts that considered the Act's constitutionality appeared to be in some disagreement on this central factual question. The District Court for the District of Nebraska concluded \\\\\\\"the banned procedure is, sometimes, the safest abortion procedure to preserve the health of women.\\\\\\\" <i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1017, 120 S.Ct. 2597. The District Court for the Northern District of California reached a similar conclusion. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1002, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (finding intact D &amp; E was \\\\\\\"under certain circumstances . . . significantly safer than D &amp; E by disarticulation\\\\\\\"). The District Court for the Southern District of New York was more skeptical of the purported health benefits of intact D &amp; E. It found the Attorney General's \\\\\\\"expert witnesses reasonably and effectively refuted [the plaintiffs'] proffered bases for the opinion that [intact D &amp; E] has safety advantages over other second-trimester abortion procedures.\\\\\\\" <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 479. In addition it did \\\\\\\"not believe that many of [the plaintiffs'] purported reasons for why [intact D &amp; E] is medically necessary [were] credible; rather [it found them to be] theoretical or false.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 480. The court nonetheless invalidated the Act because it determined \\\\\\\"a significant body of medical opinion . . . holds that D &amp; E has safety advantages over induction and that [intact D &amp; E] has some safety advantages (however hypothetical and unsubstantiated by scientific evidence) over D &amp; E for some women in some circumstances.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The question becomes whether the Act can stand when this medical uncertainty persists. The Court's precedents instruct that the Act can survive this facial attack. The Court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty. See <i>Kansas v. Hendricks,</i> 521 U.S. 346, 360, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 463 U.S. 354, 364-365, n. 13, 370, 103 S.Ct. 3043, 77 L.Ed.2d 694 (1983); <i>Lambert v. Yellowley,</i> 272 U.S. 581, 597, 47 S.Ct. 210, 71 L.Ed. 422 (1926); <i>Collins v. Texas,</i> 223 U.S. 288, 297-298, 32 S.Ct. 286, 56 L.Ed. 439 (1912); <i>Jacobson v. Massachusetts,</i> 197 U.S. 11, 30-31, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905); see also <i>Stenberg, supra,</i> at 969-972, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); <i>Marshall v. United States,</i> 414 U.S. 417, 427, 94 S.Ct. 700, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 (1974) (\\\\\\\"When Congress undertakes to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>This traditional rule is consistent with <i>Casey,</i> which confirms the State's interest in promoting respect for human life at all stages in the pregnancy. Physicians are not entitled to ignore regulations that direct them to use reasonable alternative procedures. The law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate their status above other physicians in the medical community. In <i>Casey</i> the controlling opinion held an informed-consent requirement in the abortion context was \\\\\\\"no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 884, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (joint opinion). The opinion stated \\\\\\\"the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>Webster v. Reproductive Health</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1637</span> <i>Services,</i> 492 U.S. 490, 518-519, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (plurality opinion) (criticizing <i>Roe's</i> trimester framework because, <i>inter alia,</i> it \\\\\\\"left this Court to serve as the country's <i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States\\\\\\\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Mazurek v.

See <i>Hendricks, supra,</i> at 360, n. 3, 117 S.Ct. 2072. The medical uncertainty over whether the Act's prohibition creates significant health risks provides a sufficient basis to conclude in this facial attack that the Act does not impose an undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p>The conclusion that the Act does not impose an undue burden is supported by other considerations. Alternatives are available to the prohibited procedure. As we have noted, the Act does not proscribe D &amp; E. One District Court found D &amp; E to have extremely low rates of medical complications. <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1000, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Another indicated D &amp; E was \\\\\\\"generally the safest method of abortion during the second trimester.\\\\\\\" <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1031; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 467-468 (explaining that \\\\\\\"[e]xperts testifying for both sides\\\\\\\" agreed D &amp; E was safe). In addition the Act's prohibition only applies to the delivery of \\\\\\\"a living fetus.\\\\\\\" 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV). If the intact D &amp; E procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances, it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the Act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>The instant cases, then, are different from <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 77-79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), in which the Court invalidated a ban on saline amniocentesis, the then-dominant second-trimester abortion method. The Court found the ban in <i>Danforth</i> to be \\\\\\\"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831. Here the Act allows, among other means, a commonly used and generally accepted method, so it does not construct a substantial obstacle to the abortion right.</p>\\\\n<p>In reaching the conclusion the Act does not require a health exception we reject certain arguments made by the parties on both sides of these cases. On the one hand, the Attorney General urges us to uphold the Act on the basis of the congressional findings alone. Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-380, at 23. Although we review congressional factfinding under a deferential standard, we do not in the circumstances here place dispositive weight on Congress' findings. The Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake. See <i>Crowell v. Benson,</i> 285 U.S. 22, 60, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) (\\\\\\\"In cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power of the United States necessarily extends to the independent determination of all questions, both of fact and law, necessary to the performance of that supreme function\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>As respondents have noted, and the District Courts recognized, some recitations in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1638</span> the Act are factually incorrect. See <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491. Whether or not accurate at the time, some of the important findings have been superseded. Two examples suffice. Congress determined no medical schools provide instruction on the prohibited procedure. Congressional Findings (14)(B), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769. The testimony in the District Courts, however, demonstrated intact D &amp; E is taught at medical schools. <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 490; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1029. Congress also found there existed a medical consensus that the prohibited procedure is never medically necessary. Congressional Findings (1), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 767. The evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Carhart, supra,</i> at 1012-1015, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Nat. Abortion Federation, supra,</i> at 488-489; <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> at 1025-1026. Uncritical deference to Congress' factual findings in these cases is inappropriate.</p>\\\\n<p>On the other hand, relying on the Court's opinion in <i>Stenberg,</i> respondents contend that an abortion regulation must contain a health exception \\\\\\\"if `substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular procedure could endanger women's health.'\\\\\\\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-380, p. 19 (quoting 530 U.S., at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597); see also Brief for Respondent Planned Parenthood et al. in No. 05-1382, at 12 (same). As illustrated by respondents' arguments and the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, <i>Stenberg</i> has been interpreted to leave no margin of error for legislatures to act in the face of medical uncertainty. <i>Carhart,</i> 413 F.3d, at 796; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 435 F.3d, at 1173; see also <i>Nat. Abortion Federation,</i> 437 F.3d, at 296 (Walker, C. J., concurring) (explaining the standard under <i>Stenberg</i> \\\\\\\"is a virtually insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>A zero tolerance policy would strike down legitimate abortion regulations, like the present one, if some part of the medical community were disinclined to follow the proscription. This is too exacting a standard to impose on the legislative power, exercised in this instance under the Commerce Clause, to regulate the medical profession. Considerations of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence when the regulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends. When standard medical options are available, mere convenience does not suffice to displace them; and if some procedures have different risks than others, it does not follow that the State is altogether barred from imposing reasonable regulations. The Act is not invalid on its face where there is uncertainty over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health, given the availability of other abortion procedures that are considered to be safe alternatives.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>V</h2>\\\\n<p>The considerations we have discussed support our further determination that these facial attacks should not have been entertained in the first instance. In these circumstances the proper means to consider exceptions is by as-applied challenge. The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-380, pp. 21-23. This is the proper manner to protect the health of the woman if it can be shown that in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used. In an as-applied <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1639</span> challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.</p>\\\\n<p>The latitude given facial challenges in the First Amendment context is inapplicable here. Broad challenges of this type impose \\\\\\\"a heavy burden\\\\\\\" upon the parties maintaining the suit. <i>Rust v. Sullivan,</i> 500 U.S. 173, 183, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991). What that burden consists of in the specific context of abortion statutes has been a subject of some question. Compare <i>Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U.S. 502, 514, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405 (1990) (\\\\\\\"[B]ecause appellees are making a facial challenge to a statute, they must show that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid\\\\\\\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), with <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court) (indicating a spousal-notification statute would impose an undue burden \\\\\\\"in a large fraction of the cases in which [it] is relevant\\\\\\\" and holding the statutory provision facially invalid). See also <i>Janklow v. Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic,</i> 517 U.S. 1174, 116 S.Ct. 1582, 134 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996). We need not resolve that debate.</p>\\\\n<p>As the previous sections of this opinion explain, respondents have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases. <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (opinion of the Court). We note that the statute here applies to all instances in which the doctor proposes to use the prohibited procedure, not merely those in which the woman suffers from medical complications. It is neither our obligation nor within our traditional institutional role to resolve questions of constitutionality with respect to each potential situation that might develop. \\\\\\\"[I]t would indeed be undesirable for this Court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.\\\\\\\" <i>United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, \\\\\\\"[a]s-applied challenges are the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\\\\\\\" Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.Rev. 1321, 1328 (2000).</p>\\\\n<p>The Act is open to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case. Cf. <i>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm'n,</i> 546 U.S. 410, 411-412, 126 S.Ct. 1016, 163 L.Ed.2d 990 (2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> No as-applied challenge need be brought if the prohibition in the Act threatens a woman's life because the Act already contains a life exception. 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531(a) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>Respondents have not demonstrated that the Act, as a facial matter, is void for vagueness, or that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion based on its overbreadth or lack of a health exception. For these reasons the judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Eighth and Ninth Circuits are reversed.</p>\\\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\\\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>I join the Court's opinion because it accurately applies current jurisprudence, including <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). I write separately to reiterate my view that the Court's abortion jurisprudence, including <i>Casey</i> and <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), has no basis in the Constitution.

I also note that whether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court. The parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it. See <i>Cutter v. Wilkinson,</i> 544 U.S. 709, 727, n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\\\\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 844, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), the Court declared that \\\\\\\"[l]iberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\\\\\\\" There was, the Court said, an \\\\\\\"imperative\\\\\\\" need to dispel doubt as to \\\\\\\"the meaning and reach\\\\\\\" of the Court's 7-to-2 judgment, rendered nearly two decades earlier in <i>Roe v.

Responsive to that need, the Court endeavored to provide secure guidance to \\\\\\\"[s]tate and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union,\\\\\\\" by defining \\\\\\\"the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>Taking care to speak plainly, the <i>Casey</i> Court restated and reaffirmed <i>Roe's</i> essential holding. 505 U.S., at 845-846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. First, the Court addressed the type of abortion regulation permissible prior to fetal viability. It recognized \\\\\\\"the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Second, the Court acknowledged \\\\\\\"the State's power to restrict abortions <i>after fetal viability,</i> if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life <i>or health.</i>\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Third, the Court confirmed that \\\\\\\"the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting <i>the health of the woman</i> and the life of the fetus that may become a child.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\\\\n<p>In reaffirming <i>Roe,</i> the <i>Casey</i> Court described the centrality of \\\\\\\"the decision whether to bear . . . a child,\\\\\\\" <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</i> 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), to a woman's \\\\\\\"dignity and autonomy,\\\\\\\" her \\\\\\\"personhood\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"destiny,\\\\\\\" her \\\\\\\"conception of . . . her place in society.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 851-852, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Of signal importance here, the <i>Casey</i> Court stated with unmistakable clarity that state regulation of access to abortion procedures, even after viability, must protect \\\\\\\"the health of the woman.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\\\\n<p>Seven years ago, in <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000), the Court invalidated a Nebraska statute criminalizing the performance of a medical procedure that, in the political arena, has been dubbed \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion.\\\\\\\"<sup>[1]</sup> With fidelity to the <i>Roe-Casey</i> line of precedent, the Court held the Nebraska statute unconstitutional in part because <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1641</span> it lacked the requisite protection for the preservation of a woman's health. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597; cf. <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 327, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006).</p>\\\\n<p>Today's decision is alarming. It refuses to take <i>Casey</i> and <i>Stenberg</i> seriously. It tolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). It blurs the line, firmly drawn in <i>Casey,</i> between previability and postviability abortions. And, for the first time since <i>Roe,</i> the Court blesses a prohibition with no exception safeguarding a woman's health.</p>\\\\n<p>I dissent from the Court's disposition. Retreating from prior rulings that abortion restrictions cannot be imposed absent an exception safeguarding a woman's health, the Court upholds an Act that surely would not survive under the close scrutiny that previously attended state-decreed limitations on a woman's reproductive choices.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>As <i>Casey</i> comprehended, at stake in cases challenging abortion restrictions is a woman's \\\\\\\"control over her [own] destiny.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 869, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion). See also <i>id.,</i> at 852, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (majority opinion).<sup>[2]</sup> \\\\\\\"There was a time, not so long ago,\\\\\\\" when women were \\\\\\\"regarded as the center of home and family life, with attendant special responsibilities that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 896-897, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (quoting <i>Hoyt v. Florida,</i> 368 U.S. 57, 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961)). Those views, this Court made clear in <i>Casey,</i> \\\\\\\"are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 897, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Women, it is now acknowledged, have the talent, capacity, and right \\\\\\\"to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 856, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Their ability to realize their full potential, the Court recognized, is intimately connected to \\\\\\\"their ability to control their reproductive lives.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L.Rev. 261 (1992); Law, Rethinking Sex and the Constitution, 132 U. Pa. L.Rev. 955, 1002-1028 (1984).</p>\\\\n<p>In keeping with this comprehension of the right to reproductive choice, the Court has consistently required that laws regulating abortion, at any stage of pregnancy and in all cases, safeguard a woman's health. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 327-328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (\\\\\\\"[O]ur precedents hold. . . that a State may not restrict access to abortions that are necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for preservation of the life or health of the [woman].\\\\\\\" (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 879, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion))); <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1642</span> 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\\\\\\\"Since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.\\\\\\\"). See also <i>Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U.S. 747, 768-769, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (invalidating a <i>post</i>-viability abortion regulation for \\\\\\\"fail[ure] to require that [a pregnant woman's] health be the physician's paramount consideration\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>We have thus ruled that a State must avoid subjecting women to health risks not only where the pregnancy itself creates danger, but also where state regulation forces women to resort to less safe methods of abortion. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U.S. 52, 79, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (holding unconstitutional a ban on a method of abortion that \\\\\\\"force[d] a woman . . . to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health\\\\\\\"). See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 931, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\\\\\\\"[Our cases] make clear that a risk to . . . women's health is the same whether it happens to arise from regulating a particular method of abortion, or from barring abortion entirely.\\\\\\\"). Indeed, we have applied the rule that abortion regulation must safeguard a woman's health to the particular procedure at issue here\\u00c2\\u2014intact dilation and evacuation (D &amp; E).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Stenberg,</i> we expressly held that a statute banning intact D &amp; E was unconstitutional in part because it lacked a health exception. 530 U.S., at 930, 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We noted that there existed a \\\\\\\"division of medical opinion\\\\\\\" about the relative safety of intact D &amp; E, <i>id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597, but we made clear that as long as \\\\\\\"substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health,\\\\\\\" a health exception is required, <i>id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597. We explained:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The word `necessary' in <i>Casey's</i> phrase `necessary, in appropriate medical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1643</span> judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the [pregnant woman],' cannot refer to an absolute necessity or to absolute proof. Medical treatments and procedures are often considered appropriate (or inappropriate) in light of estimated comparative health risks (and health benefits) in particular cases. Neither can that phrase require unanimity of medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of comparative health risks and appropriate treatment. And <i>Casey's</i> words `appropriate medical judgment' must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion. . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 937, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Thus, we reasoned, division in medical opinion \\\\\\\"at most means uncertainty, a factor that signals the presence of risk, not its absence.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> \\\\\\\"[A] statute that altogether forbids [intact D &amp; E]. . . . consequently must contain a health exception.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 938, 120 S.Ct. 2597.

See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1025-1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Third,</i> intact D &amp; E diminishes the chances of exposing the patient's tissues to sharp bony fragments sometimes resulting from dismemberment of the fetus. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 471; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001. <i>Fourth,</i> intact D &amp; E takes less operating time than D &amp; E by dismemberment, and thus may reduce bleeding, the risk of infection, and complications relating to anesthesia. See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 923-928, 1026; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 472; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1001.

See <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1027; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 482, 488-491; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1032. The trial courts concluded, in contrast to Congress' findings, that \\\\\\\"significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] is the safest procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1033 (quoting <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597); accord <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1008-1009, 1017-1018; <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 480-482;<sup>[5]</sup> cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (\\\\\\\"[T]he record shows that significant medical authority supports the proposition that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1646</span> in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>The District Courts' findings merit this Court's respect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a); <i>Salve Regina College v. Russell,</i> 499 U.S. 225, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991). Today's opinion supplies no reason to reject those findings. Nevertheless, despite the District Courts' appraisal of the weight of the evidence, and in undisguised conflict with <i>Stenberg,</i> the Court asserts that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act can survive \\\\\\\"when . . . medical uncertainty persists.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1636. This assertion is bewildering. Not only does it defy the Court's longstanding precedent affirming the necessity of a health exception, with no carve-out for circumstances of medical uncertainty, see <i>supra,</i> at 1641-1642; it gives short shrift to the records before us, carefully canvassed by the District Courts. Those records indicate that \\\\\\\"the majority of highly-qualified experts on the subject believe intact D &amp; E to be the safest, most appropriate procedure under certain circumstances.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 1034. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court acknowledges some of this evidence, <i>ante,</i> at 1635, but insists that, because some witnesses disagreed with the ACOG and other experts' assessment of risk, the Act can stand. <i>Ante,</i> at 1635-1636, 1638-1639. In this insistence, the Court brushes under the rug the District Courts' well-supported findings that the physicians who testified that intact D &amp; E is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman had slim authority for their opinions. They had no training for, or personal experience with, the intact D &amp; E procedure, and many performed abortions only on rare occasions. See <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 980; <i>Carhart,</i> 331 F.Supp.2d, at 1025; cf. <i>National Abortion Federation,</i> 330 F.Supp.2d, at 462-464. Even indulging the assumption that the Government witnesses were equally qualified to evaluate the relative risks of abortion procedures, their testimony could not erase the \\\\\\\"significant medical authority support[ing] the proposition that in some circumstances, [intact D &amp; E] would be the safest procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 932, 120 S.Ct. 2597.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court offers flimsy and transparent justifications for upholding a nationwide <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1647</span> ban on intact D &amp; E <i>sans</i> any exception to safeguard a women's health. Today's ruling, the Court declares, advances \\\\\\\"a premise central to [<i>Casey's</i>] conclusion\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014<i>i.e.,</i> the Government's \\\\\\\"legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625-1626. See also <i>ante,</i> at 1626 (\\\\\\\"[W]e must determine whether the Act furthers the legitimate interest of the Government in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child.\\\\\\\"). But the Act scarcely furthers that interest: The law saves not a single fetus from destruction, for it targets only a <i>method</i> of performing abortion. See <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 930, 120 S.Ct. 2597. And surely the statute was not designed to protect the lives or health of pregnant women. <i>Id.,</i> at 951, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring); cf. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (recognizing along with the State's legitimate interest in the life of the fetus, its \\\\\\\"legitimate interes[t]. . . in protecting the <i>health of the woman</i>\\\\\\\" (emphasis added)). In short, the Court upholds a law that, while doing nothing to \\\\\\\"preserv[e] . . . fetal life,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 1626, bars a woman from choosing intact D &amp; E although her doctor \\\\\\\"reasonably believes [that procedure] will best protect [her].\\\\\\\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\\\\n<p>As another reason for upholding the ban, the Court emphasizes that the Act does not proscribe the nonintact D &amp; E procedure. See <i>ante,</i> at 1637. But why not, one might ask. Nonintact D &amp; E could equally be characterized as \\\\\\\"brutal,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 1633, involving as it does \\\\\\\"tear[ing] [a fetus] apart\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"ripp[ing] off\\\\\\\" its limbs, <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622. \\\\\\\"[T]he notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures . . . is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply irrational.\\\\\\\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 946-947, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).</p>\\\\n<p>Delivery of an intact, albeit nonviable, fetus warrants special condemnation, the Court maintains, because a fetus that is not dismembered resembles an infant. <i>Ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But so, too, does a fetus delivered intact after it is terminated by injection a day or two before the surgical evacuation, <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1637-1638, or a fetus delivered through medical induction or cesarean, <i>ante,</i> at 1644. Yet, the availability of those procedures\\u00c2\\u2014along with D &amp; E by dismemberment\\u00c2\\u2014the Court says, saves the ban on intact D &amp; E from a declaration of unconstitutionality. <i>Ante,</i> at 1637-1638. Never mind that the procedures deemed acceptable might put a woman's health at greater risk. See <i>supra,</i> at 1646, and n. 6; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1621, 1635-1636.</p>\\\\n<p>Ultimately, the Court admits that \\\\\\\"moral concerns\\\\\\\" are at work, concerns that could yield prohibitions on any abortion. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (\\\\\\\"Congress could. . . conclude that the type of abortion proscribed by the Act requires specific regulation because it implicates additional ethical and moral concerns that justify a special prohibition.\\\\\\\"). Notably, the concerns expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government's interest in preserving life. By allowing such concerns to carry the day and case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\\\\\\\"Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\\\\\\\"); <i>Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 571, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (Though \\\\\\\"[f]or many persons [objections to homosexual conduct] are not trivial concerns <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1648</span> but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles,\\\\\\\" the power of the State may not be used \\\\\\\"to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.\\\\\\\" (citing <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 850, 112 S.Ct. 2791)).</p>\\\\n<p>Revealing in this regard, the Court invokes an antiabortion shibboleth for which it concededly has no reliable evidence: Women who have abortions come to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from \\\\\\\"[s]evere depression and loss of esteem.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1634.<sup>[7]</sup> Because of women's fragile emotional state and because of the \\\\\\\"bond of love the mother has for her child,\\\\\\\" the Court worries, doctors may withhold information about the nature of the intact D &amp; E procedure. <i>Ante,</i> at 1633-1634.<sup>[8]</sup> The solution the Court approves, then, is <i>not</i> to require doctors to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1649</span> inform women, accurately and adequately, of the different procedures and their attendant risks. Cf. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 873, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (plurality opinion) (\\\\\\\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\\\\\\\"). Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women's place in the family and under the Constitution\\u00c2\\u2014ideas that have long since been discredited.

Instead of drawing the line at viability, the Court refers to Congress' purpose to differentiate \\\\\\\"abortion and infanticide\\\\\\\" based not on whether a fetus can survive outside the womb, but on where a fetus is anatomically located when a particular medical procedure is performed. See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634 (quoting Congressional Findings (14)(G), in notes following 18 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1531 (2000 ed., Supp. IV), p. 769).</p>\\\\n<p>One wonders how long a line that saves no fetus from destruction will hold in face of the Court's \\\\\\\"moral concerns.\\\\\\\" See <i>supra,</i> at 1647; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 1627 (noting that \\\\\\\"[i]n this litigation\\\\\\\" the Attorney General \\\\\\\"does not dispute that the Act would impose an undue burden if it covered standard D &amp; E\\\\\\\"). The Court's hostility to the right <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> secured is not concealed. Throughout, the opinion refers to obstetrician-gynecologists and surgeons who perform abortions not by the titles of their medical specialties, but by the pejorative label \\\\\\\"abortion doctor.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1625, 1631, 1632, 1635, 1636.

Instead of the heightened scrutiny we have previously applied, the Court determines that a \\\\\\\"rational\\\\\\\" ground is enough to uphold the Act, <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634, 1638. And, most troubling, <i>Casey's</i> principles, confirming the continuing vitality of \\\\\\\"the essential holding of <i>Roe,</i>\\\\\\\" are merely \\\\\\\"assume[d]\\\\\\\" for the moment, <i>ante,</i> at 1626, 1635, rather than \\\\\\\"retained\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"reaffirmed,\\\\\\\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.S., at 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court further confuses our jurisprudence when it declares that \\\\\\\"facial attacks\\\\\\\" are not permissible in \\\\\\\"these circumstances,\\\\\\\" <i>i.e.,</i> where medical uncertainty exists. <i>Ante,</i> at 1638; see <i>ibid.</i> (\\\\\\\"In an as-applied challenge the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced than in a facial attack.\\\\\\\").

But <i>Casey</i> makes clear that, in determining whether any restriction poses an undue burden on a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of women, the relevant class is <i>not</i> \\\\\\\"all women,\\\\\\\" nor \\\\\\\"all pregnant women,\\\\\\\" nor even all women \\\\\\\"seeking abortions.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 895, 112 S.Ct. 2791. Rather, a provision restricting access to abortion, \\\\\\\"must be judged by reference to those [women] for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> Thus the absence of a health exception burdens <i>all</i> women for whom it is relevant\\u00c2\\u2014women who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D &amp; E because other procedures would place their health at risk.<sup>[10]</sup> Cf. <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 934, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (accepting the \\\\\\\"relative rarity\\\\\\\" of medically indicated intact D &amp; Es as true but not \\\\\\\"highly relevant\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014for \\\\\\\"the health exception question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception for those infrequent occasions\\\\\\\"); <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961 (facial challenge entertained where \\\\\\\"[i]n some very small percentage of cases ... women ... need immediate abortions to avert serious, and often irreversible damage to their health\\\\\\\"). It makes no sense to conclude that this facial challenge fails because respondents have not shown that a health exception is necessary for a large fraction of second-trimester abortions, including those for which a health exception is unnecessary: The very purpose of a health <i>exception</i> is to protect women in <i>exceptional</i> cases.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>If there is anything at all redemptive to be said of today's opinion, it is that the Court is not willing to foreclose entirely a constitutional challenge to the Act. \\\\\\\"The Act is open,\\\\\\\" the Court states, \\\\\\\"to a proper as-applied challenge in a discrete case.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1639; see <i>ante,</i> at 1639 (\\\\\\\"The Government has acknowledged that preenforcement, as-applied challenges to the Act can be maintained.\\\\\\\"). But the Court offers no clue on what a \\\\\\\"proper\\\\\\\" lawsuit might look like. See <i>ante,</i> at 1638-1639. Nor does the Court explain why the injunctions ordered by the District Courts should not remain in place, trimmed only to exclude instances in which another procedure would safeguard a woman's health at least equally well. Surely the Court cannot mean that no suit may be brought until a woman's health is immediately jeopardized by the ban on intact D &amp; E. A woman \\\\\\\"suffer[ing] from medical complications,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639, needs access to the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1652</span> medical procedure at once and cannot wait for the judicial process to unfold. See <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 328, 126 S.Ct. 961.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court appears, then, to contemplate another lawsuit by the initiators of the instant actions. In such a second round, the Court suggests, the challengers could succeed upon demonstrating that \\\\\\\"in discrete and well-defined instances a particular condition has or is likely to occur in which the procedure prohibited by the Act must be used.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1638. One may anticipate that such a preenforcement challenge will be mounted swiftly, to ward off serious, sometimes irremediable harm, to women whose health would be endangered by the intact D &amp; E prohibition.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court envisions that in an as-applied challenge, \\\\\\\"the nature of the medical risk can be better quantified and balanced.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> But it should not escape notice that the record already includes hundreds and hundreds of pages of testimony identifying \\\\\\\"discrete and well-defined instances\\\\\\\" in which recourse to an intact D &amp; E would better protect the health of women with particular conditions. See <i>supra,</i> at 1644-1645. Record evidence also documents that medical exigencies, unpredictable in advance, may indicate to a well-trained doctor that intact D &amp; E is the safest procedure. See ibid. In light of this evidence, our unanimous decision just one year ago in <i>Ayotte</i> counsels against reversal. See 546 U.S., at 331, 126 S.Ct. 961 (remanding for reconsideration of the remedy for the absence of a health exception, suggesting that an injunction prohibiting unconstitutional applications might suffice).</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's allowance only of an \\\\\\\"as-applied challenge in a discrete case,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 1639\\u00c2\\u2014jeopardizes women's health and places doctors in an untenable position. Even if courts were able to carve-out exceptions through piecemeal litigation for \\\\\\\"discrete and well-defined instances,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 1638, women whose circumstances have not been anticipated by prior litigation could well be left unprotected. In treating those women, physicians would risk criminal prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment if they exercise their best judgment as to the safest medical procedure for their patients. The Court is thus gravely mistaken to conclude that narrow as-applied challenges are \\\\\\\"the proper manner to protect the health of the woman.\\\\\\\" Cf. <i>ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>As the Court wrote in <i>Casey,</i> \\\\\\\"overruling <i>Roe's</i> central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\\\\\\\" 505 U.S., at 865, 112 S.Ct. 2791. \\\\\\\"[T]he very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 854, 112 S.Ct. 2791. See also <i>id.,</i> at 867, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (\\\\\\\"[T]o overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question.\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Though today's opinion does not go so far as to discard <i>Roe</i> or <i>Casey,</i> the Court, differently composed than it was when we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation, is hardly faithful to our earlier invocations of \\\\\\\"the rule of law\\\\\\\" and the \\\\\\\"principles of <i>stare decisis.</i>\\\\\\\" Congress imposed a ban despite our clear prior holdings that the State cannot proscribe an abortion procedure when its use is necessary to protect a woman's health. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. Although Congress' findings could not withstand the crucible of trial, the Court <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1653</span> defers to the legislative override of our Constitution-based rulings. See <i>supra,</i> at 1643-1644. A decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power.</p>\\\\n<p>In sum, the notion that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate governmental interest is, quite simply, irrational. The Court's defense of the statute provides no saving explanation. In candor, the Act, and the Court's defense of it, cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court\\u00c2\\u2014 and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives. See <i>supra,</i> at 1641, n. 2; <i>supra,</i> at 1643, n. 4. When \\\\\\\"a statute burdens constitutional rights and all that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those rights, the burden is undue.\\\\\\\" <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 952, 120 S.Ct. 2597 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Hope Clinic v.

See <i>Planned Parenthood Federation of Am. v. Ashcroft,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d 957, 964 (N.D.Cal.2004), aff'd, 435 F.3d 1163 (C.A.9 2006). The medical community refers to the procedure as either dilation &amp; extraction (D &amp; X) or intact dilation and evacuation (intact D &amp; E). See, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 1621; <i>Stenberg v. Carhart,</i> 530 U.S. 914, 927, 120 S.Ct. 2597, 147 L.Ed.2d 743 (2000).</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U.S. 833, 851-852, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), described more precisely than did <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), the impact of abortion restrictions on women's liberty. <i>Roe's</i> focus was in considerable measure on \\\\\\\"vindicat[ing] the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 165, 93 S.Ct. 705.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  Dilation and evacuation (D &amp; E) is the most frequently used abortion procedure during the second trimester of pregnancy; intact D &amp; E is a variant of the D &amp; E procedure. See <i>ante,</i> at 1620-1621, 1621-1622; <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 924, 927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> 320 F.Supp.2d, at 966. Second-trimester abortions (<i>i.e.,</i> midpregnancy, previability abortions) are, however, relatively uncommon. Between 85 and 90 percent of all abortions performed in the United States take place during the first three months of pregnancy. See <i>ante,</i> at 1620. See also <i>Stenberg,</i> 530 U.S., at 923-927, 120 S.Ct. 2597; <i>National Abortion Federation v.

Minors may be unaware they are pregnant until relatively late in pregnancy, while poor women's financial constraints are an obstacle to timely receipt of services. See Finer, Frohwirth, Dauphinee, Singh, &amp; Moore, Timing of Steps and Reasons for Delays in Obtaining Abortions in the United States, 74 Contraception 334, 341-343 (2006). See also Drey et al., Risk Factors Associated with Presenting for Abortion in the Second Trimester, 107 Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology 128, 133 (Jan.2006) (concluding that women who have second-trimester abortions typically discover relatively late that they are pregnant). Severe fetal anomalies and health problems confronting the pregnant woman are also causes of second-trimester abortions; many such conditions cannot be diagnosed or do not develop until the second trimester. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Finer, <i>supra,</i> at 344; F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 242, 290, 328-329, (22d ed.2005); cf.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> 149 Cong. Rec. 5731 (2003) (statement of Sen. Santorum) (\\\\\\\"Why are we here? We are here because the Supreme Court defended the indefensible. . . . We have responded to the Supreme Court.\\\\\\\"). See also 148 Cong. Rec. 14273 (2002) (statement of Rep.

But a \\\\\\\"significant body of medical opinion believes that inducing fetal death by injection is almost always inappropriate to the preservation of the health of women undergoing abortion because it poses tangible risk and provides no benefit to the woman.\\\\\\\" <i>Carhart v.

The Court also identifies medical induction of labor as an alternative. See <i>ante,</i> at 1644. That procedure, however, requires a hospital stay, <i>ibid.,</i> rendering it inaccessible to patients who lack financial resources, and it too is considered less safe for many women, and impermissible for others.

See <i>ante,</i> at 1633-1634. But \\\\\\\"neither the weight of the scientific evidence to date nor the observable reality of 33 years of legal abortion in the United States comports with the idea that having an abortion is any more dangerous to a woman's long-term mental health than delivering and parenting a child that she did not intend to have. . . .\\\\\\\" Cohen, Abortion and Mental Health: Myths and Realities, 9 Guttmacher Policy Rev. 8 (2006); see generally Bazelon, Is There a Post-Abortion Syndrome?

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\\\\n<p>This case presents statutory and constitutional questions concerning the public funding of abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, commonly known as the \\\\\\\"Medicaid\\\\\\\" Act, and recent annual Appropriations Acts containing <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*301</span> the so-called \\\\\\\"Hyde Amendment.\\\\\\\" The statutory question is whether Title XIX requires a State that participates in the Medicaid program to fund the cost of medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. The constitutional question, which arises only if Title XIX imposes no such requirement, is whether the Hyde Amendment, by denying public funding for certain medically necessary abortions, contravenes the liberty or equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, or either of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>The Medicaid program was created in 1965, when Congress added Title XIX to the Social Security Act, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1396 <i>et seq.</i> (1976 ed. and Supp. II), for the purpose of providing federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons. Although participation in the Medicaid program is entirely optional, once a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX.</p>\\\\n<p>One such requirement is that a participating State agree to provide financial assistance to the \\\\\\\"categorically needy\\\\\\\"<sup>[1]</sup> with respect to five general areas of medical treatment: (1) inpatient hospital services, (2) outpatient hospital services, (3) other laboratory and X-ray services, (4) skilled nursing <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*302</span> facilities services, periodic screening and diagnosis of children, and family planning services, and (5) services of physicians. 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1396a (a) (13) (B), 1396d (a) (1)-(5). Although a participating State need not \\\\\\\"provide funding for all medical treatment falling within the five general categories, [Title XIX] does require that [a] state Medicaid pla[n] establish `reasonable standards . . . for determining . . . the extent of medical assistance under the plan which . . . are consistent with the objectives of [Title XIX].' 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1396a (a) (17).\\\\\\\" <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438, 441.</p>\\\\n<p>Since September 1976, Congress has prohibited\\u00c2\\u2014either by an amendment to the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare<sup>[2]</sup> or by a joint resolution\\u00c2\\u2014the use of any federal funds to reimburse the cost of abortions under the Medicaid program except under certain specified circumstances. This funding restriction is commonly known as the \\\\\\\"Hyde Amendment,\\\\\\\" after its original congressional sponsor, Representative Hyde. The current version of the Hyde Amendment, applicable for fiscal year 1980, provides:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[N]one of the funds provided by this joint resolution shall be used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term; or except for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service.\\\\\\\" Pub. L. 96-123, \\u00c2\\u00a7 109, 93 Stat. 926.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>See also Pub. L. 96-86, \\u00c2\\u00a7 118, 93 Stat. 662. This version of the Hyde Amendment is broader than that applicable for fiscal year 1977, which did not include the \\\\\\\"rape or incest\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*303</span> exception, Pub. L. 94-439, \\u00c2\\u00a7 209, 90 Stat. 1434, but narrower than that applicable for most of fiscal year 1978,<sup>[3]</sup> and all of fiscal year 1979, which had an additional exception for \\\\\\\"instances where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians,\\\\\\\" Pub. L. 95-205, \\u00c2\\u00a7 101, 91 Stat. 1460; Pub. L. 95-480, \\u00c2\\u00a7 210, 92 Stat. 1586.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>On September 30, 1976, the day on which Congress enacted the initial version of the Hyde Amendment, these consolidated cases were filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs\\u00c2\\u2014Cora McRae, a New York Medicaid recipient then in the first trimester of a pregnancy that she wished to terminate, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., a public benefit corporation that operates 16 hospitals, 12 of which provide abortion services, and others\\u00c2\\u2014sought to enjoin the enforcement of the funding restriction on abortions. They alleged that the Hyde Amendment violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments of the Constitution insofar as it limited the funding of abortions to those necessary to save the life of the mother, while permitting the funding of costs associated with childbirth. Although the sole named defendant was the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the District Court permitted Senators James L. Buckley and Jesse A. Helms and Representative Henry J. Hyde to intervene as defendants.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*304</span> After a hearing, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Secretary from enforcing the Hyde Amendment and requiring him to continue to provide federal reimbursement for abortions under the standards applicable before the funding restriction had been enacted. <i>McRae</i> v. <i>Mathews,</i> 421 F. Supp. 533. Although stating that it had not expressly held that the funding restriction was unconstitutional, since the preliminary injunction was not its final judgment, the District Court noted that such a holding was \\\\\\\"implicit\\\\\\\" in its decision granting the injunction. The District Court also certified the <i>McRae</i> case as a class action on behalf of all pregnant or potentially pregnant women in the State of New York eligible for Medicaid and who decide to have an abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, and of all authorized providers of abortion services to such women. <i>Id.,</i> at 543.</p>\\\\n<p>The Secretary then brought an appeal to this Court. After deciding <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438, and <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, we vacated the injunction of the District Court and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of those decisions. <i>Califano</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 433 U. S. 916.</p>\\\\n<p>On remand, the District Court permitted the intervention of several additional plaintiffs, including (1) four individual Medicaid recipients who wished to have abortions that allegedly were medically necessary but did not qualify for federal funds under the versions of the Hyde Amendment applicable in fiscal years 1977 and 1978, (2) several physicians who perform abortions for Medicaid recipients, (3) the Women's Division of the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church (Women's Division), and (4) two individual officers of the Women's Division.</p>\\\\n<p>An amended complaint was then filed, challenging the various versions of the Hyde Amendment on several grounds. At the outset, the plaintiffs asserted that the District Court need not address the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*305</span> because, in their view, a participating State remains obligated under Title XIX to fund all medically necessary abortions, even if federal reimbursement is unavailable. With regard to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, the plaintiffs asserted, among other things, that the funding restrictions violate the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>After a lengthy trial, which inquired into the medical reasons for abortions and the diverse religious views on the subject,<sup>[6]</sup> the District Court filed an opinion and entered a judgment invalidating all versions of the Hyde Amendment on constitutional grounds.<sup>[7]</sup> The District Court rejected the plaintiffs' statutory argument, concluding that even though Title XIX would otherwise have required a participating State to fund medically necessary abortions, the Hyde Amendment had substantively amended Title XIX to relieve a State of that funding obligation. Turning then to the constitutional issues, the District Court concluded that the Hyde Amendment, though valid under the Establishment Clause,<sup>[8]</sup> violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. With regard to the Fifth Amendment, the District Court noted that when an abortion is \\\\\\\"medically necessary to safeguard the pregnant woman's health, . . . the disentitlement to [M]edicaid assistance impinges directly on the woman's right to decide, in consultation with her physician and in reliance on his judgment, to terminate <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*306</span> her pregnancy in order to preserve her health.\\\\\\\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>McRae</i> v. <i>Califano,</i> 491 F. Supp. 630, 737. The court concluded that the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection guarantee because, in its view, the decision of Congress to fund medically necessary services generally but only certain medically necessary abortions serves no legitimate governmental interest. As to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the court held that insofar as a woman's decision to seek a medically necessary abortion may be a product of her religious beliefs under certain Protestant and Jewish tenets, the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate that constitutional guarantee as well.</p>\\\\n<p>Accordingly, the District Court ordered the Secretary to \\\\\\\"[c]ease to give effect\\\\\\\" to the various versions of the Hyde Amendment insofar as they forbid payments for medically necessary abortions. It further directed the Secretary to \\\\\\\"[c]ontinue to authorize the expenditure of federal matching funds [for such abortions].\\\\\\\" App. 87. In addition, the court recertified the <i>McRae</i> case as a nationwide class action on behalf of all pregnant and potentially pregnant women eligible for Medicaid who wish to have medically necessary abortions, and of all authorized providers of abortions for such women.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The Secretary then applied to this Court for a stay of the judgment pending direct appeal of the District Court's decision. We denied the stay, but noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal. 444 U. S. 1069.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>It is well settled that if a case may be decided on either statutory or constitutional grounds, this Court, for sound <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*307</span> jurisprudential reasons, will inquire first into the statutory question. This practice reflects the deeply rooted doctrine \\\\\\\"that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality. . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\\\\\\\" <i>Spector Motor Service, Inc.</i> v. <i>McLaughlin,</i> 323 U. S. 101, 105. Accordingly, we turn first to the question whether Title XIX requires a State that participates in the Medicaid program to continue to fund those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. If a participating State is under such an obligation, the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment need not be drawn into question in the present case, for the availability of medically necessary abortions under Medicaid would continue, with the participating State shouldering the total cost of funding such abortions.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellees assert that a participating State has an independent funding obligation under Title XIX because (1) the Hyde Amendment is, by its own terms, only a limitation on federal reimbursement for certain medically necessary abortions, and (2) Title XIX does not permit a participating State to exclude from its Medicaid plan any medically necessary service solely on the basis of diagnosis or condition, even if federal reimbursement is unavailable for that service.<sup>[11]</sup> It is thus the appellees' view that the effect of the Hyde Amendment is to withhold federal reimbursement for certain medically necessary abortions, but not to relieve a participating <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*308</span> State of its duty under Title XIX to provide for such abortions in its Medicaid plan.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court rejected this argument. It concluded that, although Title XIX would otherwise have required a participating State to include medically necessary abortions in its Medicaid program, the Hyde Amendment substantively amended Title XIX so as to relieve a State of that obligation. This construction of the Hyde Amendment was said to find support in the decisions of two Courts of Appeals, <i>Preterm, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukakis,</i> 591 F. 2d 121 (CA1 1979), and <i>Zbaraz</i> v. <i>Quern,</i> 596 F. 2d 196 (CA7 1979), and to be consistent with the understanding of the effect of the Hyde Amendment by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the administration of the Medicaid program.</p>\\\\n<p>We agree with the District Court, but for somewhat different reasons. The Medicaid program created by Title XIX is a cooperative endeavor in which the Federal Government provides financial assistance to participating States to aid them in furnishing health care to needy persons. Under this system of \\\\\\\"cooperative federalism,\\\\\\\" <i>King</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 392 U. S. 309, 316, if a State agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, which include several mandatory categories of health services, the Federal Government agrees to pay a specified percentage of \\\\\\\"the total amount expended . . . as medical assistance under the State plan. . . .\\\\\\\" 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1396b (a) (1). The cornerstone of Medicaid is financial contribution by both the Federal Government and the participating State. Nothing in Title XIX as originally enacted, or in its legislative history, suggests that Congress intended to require a participating State to assume the full costs of providing any health services in its Medicaid plan. Quite the contrary, the purpose of Congress in enacting Title XIX was to provide federal financial assistance for all legitimate state expenditures under an approved Medicaid plan. See S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*309</span> Sess., pt. 1, pp. 83-85 (1965); H. R. Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 72-74 (1965).</p>\\\\n<p>Since the Congress that enacted Title XIX did not intend a participating State to assume a unilateral funding obligation for any health service in an approved Medicaid plan, it follows that Title XIX does not require a participating State to include in its plan any services for which a subsequent Congress has withheld federal funding.<sup>[12]</sup> Title XIX was designed as a cooperative program of shared financial responsibility, not as a device for the Federal Government to compel a State to provide services that Congress itself is unwilling to fund. Thus, if Congress chooses to withdraw federal funding for a particular service, a State is not obliged to continue to pay for that service as a condition of continued federal financial support of other services. This is not to say that Congress may not now depart from the original design of Title XIX under which the Federal Government shares the financial responsibility for expenses incurred under an approved Medicaid plan. It is only to say that, absent an indication of contrary legislative intent by a subsequent Congress, Title XIX does not obligate a participating State to pay for those medical services for which federal reimbursement is unavailable.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*310</span> Thus, by the normal operation of Title XIX, even if a State were otherwise required to include medically necessary abortions in its Medicaid plan, the withdrawal of federal funding under the Hyde Amendment would operate to relieve the State of that obligation for those abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable.<sup>[14]</sup> The legislative history of the Hyde Amendment contains no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to shift the entire cost of such services to the participating States. See <i>Zbaraz</i> v. <i>Quern, supra,</i> at 200 (\\\\\\\"no one, whether supporting or opposing the Hyde Amendment, ever suggested that state funding would be required\\\\\\\"). Rather, the legislative history suggests that Congress has always assumed that a participating State would not be required to fund medically necessary abortions once federal funding was withdrawn pursuant to the Hyde Amendment.<sup>[15]</sup> See <i>Preterm, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukakis, supra,</i> at 130 (\\\\\\\"[t]he universal assumption in debate was that if the Amendment passed there would be no requirement that states carry on the service\\\\\\\"). Accord, <i>Zbaraz</i> v. <i>Quern, supra,</i> at 200; <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Board of County Comm'rs,</i> 614 F. 2d 601, 612-613 (CA8 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*311</span> 1980); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 623 F. 2d 829, 834-837 (CA3 1980). Accordingly, we conclude that Title XIX does not require a participating State to pay for those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>Having determined that Title XIX does not obligate a participating State to pay for those medically necessary abortions for which Congress has withheld federal funding, we must consider the constitutional validity of the Hyde Amendment. The appellees assert that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate several rights secured by the Constitution\\u00c2\\u2014 (1) the right of a woman, implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, (2) the prohibition under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment against any \\\\\\\"law respecting an establishment of religion,\\\\\\\" and (3) the right to freedom of religion protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The appellees also contend that, quite apart from substantive constitutional rights, the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*312</span> It is well settled that, quite apart from the guarantee of equal protection, if a law \\\\\\\"impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly secured by the Constitution [it] is presumptively unconstitutional.\\\\\\\" <i>Mobile</i> v. <i>Bolden,</i> 446 U. S. 55, 76 (plurality opinion). Accordingly, before turning to the equal protection issue in this case, we examine whether the Hyde Amendment violates any substantive rights secured by the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>We address first the appellees' argument that the Hyde Amendment, by restricting the availability of certain medically necessary abortions under Medicaid, impinges on the \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" protected by the Due Process Clause as recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, and its progeny.</p>\\\\n<p>In the <i>Wade</i> case, this Court held unconstitutional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure or attempt an abortion except on medical advice for the purpose of saving the mother's life. The constitutional underpinning of <i>Wade</i> was a recognition that the \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment includes not only the freedoms explicitly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, but also a freedom of personal choice in certain matters of marriage and family life.<sup>[18]</sup> This implicit constitutional liberty, the Court in <i>Wade</i> held, includes the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*313</span> But the Court in <i>Wade</i> also recognized that a State has legitimate interests during a pregnancy in both ensuring the health of the mother and protecting potential human life. These state interests, which were found to be \\\\\\\"separate and distinct\\\\\\\" and to \\\\\\\"gro[w] in substantiality as the woman approaches term,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 162-163, pose a conflict with a woman's untrammeled freedom of choice. In resolving this conflict, the Court held that before the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, neither state interest is sufficiently substantial to justify any intrusion on the woman's freedom of choice. In the second trimester, the state interest in maternal health was found to be sufficiently substantial to justify regulation reasonably related to that concern. And at viability, usually in the third trimester, the state interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus was found to justify a criminal prohibition against abortions, except where necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Thus, inasmuch as the Texas criminal statute allowed abortions only where necessary to save the life of the mother and without regard to the stage of the pregnancy, the Court held in <i>Wade</i> that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, the Court was presented with the question whether the scope of personal constitutional freedom recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> included an entitlement to Medicaid payments for abortions that are not medically necessary. At issue in <i>Maher</i> was a Connecticut welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for medical services incident to childbirth, but not for medical services incident to nontherapeutic abortions. The District Court held that the regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the unequal subsidization of childbirth and abortion impinged on the \\\\\\\"fundamental right to abortion\\\\\\\" recognized in <i>Wade</i> and its progeny.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*314</span> It was the view of this Court that \\\\\\\"the District Court misconceived the nature and scope of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe.</i>\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 471. The doctrine of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> the Court held in <i>Maher,</i> \\\\\\\"protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 473-474, such as the severe criminal sanctions at issue in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i><i>,</i> or the absolute requirement of spousal consent for an abortion challenged in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52.</p>\\\\n<p>But the constitutional freedom recognized in <i>Wade</i> and its progeny, the <i>Maher</i> Court explained, did not prevent Connecticut from making \\\\\\\"a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and . . . implement[ing] that judgment by the allocation of public funds.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 474. As the Court elaborated:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles\\u00c2\\u2014 absolute or otherwise\\u00c2\\u2014in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficult\\u00c2\\u2014and in some cases, perhaps, impossible\\u00c2\\u2014for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The Court in <i>Maher</i> noted that its description of the doctrine recognized in <i>Wade</i> and its progeny signaled \\\\\\\"no retreat\\\\\\\" from those decisions. In explaining why the constitutional <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*315</span> principle recognized in <i>Wade</i> and later cases\\u00c2\\u2014 protecting a woman's freedom of choice\\u00c2\\u2014did not translate into a constitutional obligation of Connecticut to subsidize abortions, the Court cited the \\\\\\\"basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy. Constitutional concerns are greatest when the State attempts to impose its will by force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 475-476 (footnote omitted). Thus, even though the Connecticut regulation favored childbirth over abortion by means of subsidization of one and not the other, the Court in <i>Maher</i> concluded that the regulation did not impinge on the constitutional freedom recognized in <i>Wade</i> because it imposed no governmental restriction on access to abortions.</p>\\\\n<p>The Hyde Amendment, like the Connecticut welfare regulation at issue in <i>Maher,</i> places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy, but rather, by means of unequal subsidization of abortion and other medical services, encourages alternative activity deemed in the public interest. The present case does differ factually from <i>Maher</i> insofar as that case involved a failure to fund nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the Hyde Amendment withholds funding of certain medically necessary abortions. Accordingly, the appellees argue that because the Hyde Amendment affects a significant interest not present or asserted in <i>Maher</i>\\u00c2\\u2014the interest of a woman in protecting her health during pregnancy\\u00c2\\u2014and because that interest lies at the core of the personal constitutional freedom recognized in <i>Wade,</i> the present case is constitutionally different from <i>Maher.</i> It is the appellees' view that to the extent that the Hyde Amendment withholds funding for certain medically necessary abortions, it clearly impinges on the constitutional principle recognized in <i>Wade.</i></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*316</span> It is evident that a woman's interest in protecting her health was an important theme in <i>Wade.</i> In concluding that the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy falls within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, the Court in <i>Wade</i> emphasized the fact that the woman's decision carries with it significant personal health implications\\u00c2\\u2014both physical and psychological. 410 U. S., at 153. In fact, although the Court in <i>Wade</i> recognized that the state interest in protecting potential life becomes sufficiently compelling in the period after fetal viability to justify an absolute criminal prohibition of nontherapeutic abortions, the Court held that even after fetal viability a State may not prohibit abortions \\\\\\\"necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164. Because even the compelling interest of the State in protecting potential life after fetal viability was held to be insufficient to outweigh a woman's decision to protect her life or health, it could be argued that the freedom of a woman to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons does in fact lie at the core of the constitutional liberty identified in <i>Wade.</i></p>\\\\n<p>But, regardless of whether the freedom of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy for health reasons lies at the core or the periphery of the due process liberty recognized in <i>Wade,</i> it simply does not follow that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices. The reason why was explained in <i>Maher:</i> although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove those not of its own creation. Indigency falls in the latter category. The financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency. Although Congress has opted to subsidize <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*317</span> medically necessary services generally, but not certain medically necessary abortions, the fact remains that the Hyde Amendment leaves an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all. We are thus not persuaded that the Hyde Amendment impinges on the constitutionally protected freedom of choice recognized in <i>Wade.</i><sup>[19]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Although the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause affords protection against unwarranted government interference with freedom of choice in the context of certain personal <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*318</span> decisions, it does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom. To hold otherwise would mark a drastic change in our understanding of the Constitution. It cannot be that because government may not prohibit the use of contraceptives, <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, or prevent parents from sending their child to a private school, <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510, government, therefore, has an affirmative constitutional obligation to ensure that all persons have the financial resources to obtain contraceptives or send their children to private schools. To translate the limitation on governmental power implicit in the Due Process Clause into an affirmative funding obligation would require Congress to subsidize the medically necessary abortion of an indigent woman even if Congress had not enacted a Medicaid program to subsidize other medically necessary services. Nothing in the Due Process Clause supports such an extraordinary result.<sup>[20]</sup> Whether freedom of choice that is constitutionally protected warrants federal subsidization is a question for Congress to answer, not a matter of constitutional entitlement. Accordingly, we conclude that the Hyde Amendment does not impinge on the due process liberty recognized in <i>Wade.</i><sup>[21]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>The appellees also argue that the Hyde Amendment contravenes rights secured by the Religion Clauses of the First <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*319</span> Amendment. It is the appellees' view that the Hyde Amendment violates the Establishment Clause because it incorporates into law the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church concerning the sinfulness of abortion and the time at which life commences. Moreover, insofar as a woman's decision to seek a medically necessary abortion may be a product of her religious beliefs under certain Protestant and Jewish tenets, the appellees assert that the funding limitations of the Hyde Amendment impinge on the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>It is well settled that \\\\\\\"a legislative enactment does not contravene the Establishment Clause if it has a secular legislative purpose, if its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and if it does not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\\\\\\\" <i>Committee for Public Education</i> v. <i>Regan,</i> 444 U. S. 646, 653. Applying this standard, the District Court properly concluded that the Hyde Amendment does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause. Although neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally \\\\\\\"pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another,\\\\\\\" <i>Everson</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 330 U. S. 1, 15, it does not follow that a statute violates the Establishment Clause because it \\\\\\\"happens to coincide or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions.\\\\\\\" <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 366 U. S. 420, 442. That the Judaeo-Christian religions oppose stealing does not mean that a State or the Federal Government may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, enact laws prohibiting larceny. <i>Ibid.</i> The Hyde Amendment, as the District Court noted, is as much a reflection of \\\\\\\"traditionalist\\\\\\\" values towards abortion, as it is an embodiment of the views of any particular religion. 491 F. Supp., at 741. See also <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 138-141. In sum, we are convinced that the fact that the funding restrictions in the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*320</span> Hyde Amendment may coincide with the religious tenets of the Roman Catholic Church does not, without more, contravene the Establishment Clause.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>2</h2>\\\\n<p>We need not address the merits of the appellees' arguments concerning the Free Exercise Clause, because the appellees lack standing to raise a free exercise challenge to the Hyde Amendment. The named appellees fall into three categories: (1) the indigent pregnant women who sued on behalf of other women similarly situated, (2) the two officers of the Women's Division, and (3) the Women's Division itself.<sup>[22]</sup> The named appellees in the first category lack standing to challenge the Hyde Amendment on free exercise grounds because none alleged, much less proved, that she sought an abortion under compulsion of religious belief.<sup>[23]</sup> See <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland, supra,</i> at 429. Although the named appellees in the second category did provide a detailed description of their religious beliefs, they failed to allege either that they are or expect to be pregnant or that they are eligible to receive Medicaid. These named appellees, therefore, lack the personal stake in the controversy needed to confer standing to raise such a challenge to the Hyde Amendment. See <i>Warth</i> v. <i>Seldin,</i> 422 U. S. 490, 498-499.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, although the Women's Division alleged that its <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*321</span> membership includes \\\\\\\"pregnant Medicaid eligible women who, as a matter of religious practice and in accordance with their conscientious beliefs, would choose but are precluded or discouraged from obtaining abortions reimbursed by Medicaid because of the Hyde Amendment,\\\\\\\" the Women's Division does not satisfy the standing requirements for an organization to assert the rights of its membership. One of those requirements is that \\\\\\\"neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\\\\\\\" <i>Hunt</i> v. <i>Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n,</i> 432 U. S. 333, 343. Since \\\\\\\"it is necessary in a free exercise case for one to show the coercive effect of the enactment as it operates against him in the practice of his religion,\\\\\\\" <i>Abington School Dist.</i> v. <i>Schempp,</i> 374 U. S. 203, 223, the claim asserted here is one that ordinarily requires individual participation.<sup>[24]</sup> In the present case, the Women's Division concedes that \\\\\\\"the permissibility, advisability and/or necessity of abortion according to circumstance is a matter about which there is diversity of view within . . . our membership, and is a determination which must be ultimately and absolutely entrusted to the conscience of the individual before God.\\\\\\\" It is thus clear that the participation of individual members of the Women's Division is essential to a proper understanding and resolution of their free exercise claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the Women's Division, along with the other named appellees, lack standing to challenge the Hyde Amendment under the Free Exercise Clause.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>It remains to be determined whether the Hyde Amendment violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. This challenge is premised on the fact that, although <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*322</span> federal reimbursement is available under Medicaid for medically necessary services generally, the Hyde Amendment does not permit federal reimbursement of all medically necessary abortions. The District Court held, and the appellees argue here, that this selective subsidization violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.</p>\\\\n<p>The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties,<sup>[25]</sup> but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of classification must be sustained unless \\\\\\\"the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective.\\\\\\\" <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 366 U. S., at 425. This presumption of constitutional validity, however, disappears if a statutory classification is predicated on criteria that are, in a constitutional sense, \\\\\\\"suspect,\\\\\\\" the principal example of which is a classification based on race, <i>e. g., </i><i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>For the reasons stated above, we have already concluded that the Hyde Amendment violates no constitutionally protected substantive rights. We now conclude as well that it is not predicated on a constitutionally suspect classification. In reaching this conclusion, we again draw guidance from the Court's decision in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe</i><i>.</i> As to whether the Connecticut <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*323</span> welfare regulation providing funds for childbirth but not for nontherapeutic abortions discriminated against a suspect class, the Court in <i>Maher</i> observed:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"An indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases. Nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who cannot pay lead to a different conclusion. In a sense, every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or services. But this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 470-471, citing <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist.</i> v. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 411 U. S. 1, 29; <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 397 U. S. 471.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Thus, the Court in <i>Maher</i> found no basis for concluding that the Connecticut regulation was predicated on a suspect classification.</p>\\\\n<p>It is our view that the present case is indistinguishable from <i>Maher</i> in this respect. Here, as in <i>Maher,</i> the principal impact of the Hyde Amendment falls on the indigent. But that fact does not itself render the funding restriction constitutionally invalid, for this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>James</i> v. <i>Valtierra,</i> 402 U. S. 137. That <i>Maher</i> involved the refusal to fund nontherapeutic abortions, whereas the present case involves the refusal to fund medically necessary abortions, has no bearing on the factors that render a classification \\\\\\\"suspect\\\\\\\" within the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*324</span> 2</h2>\\\\n<p>The remaining question then is whether the Hyde Amendment is rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. It is the Government's position that the Hyde Amendment bears a rational relationship to its legitimate interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus. We agree.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Wade,</i> the Court recognized that the State has an \\\\\\\"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 162. That interest was found to exist throughout a pregnancy, \\\\\\\"grow[ing] in substantiality as the woman approaches term.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 162-163. See also <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S., at 445-446. Moreover, in <i>Maher,</i> the Court held that Connecticut's decision to fund the costs associated with childbirth but not those associated with nontherapeutic abortions was a rational means of advancing the legitimate state interest in protecting potential life by <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*325</span> encouraging childbirth. 432 U. S., at 478-479. See also <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519, 520-521.</p>\\\\n<p>It follows that the Hyde Amendment, by encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances, is rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life. By subsidizing the medical expenses of indigent women who carry their pregnancies to term while not subsidizing the comparable expenses of women who undergo abortions (except those whose lives are threatened),<sup>[27]</sup> Congress has established incentives that make childbirth a more attractive alternative than abortion for persons eligible for Medicaid. These incentives bear a direct relationship to the legitimate congressional interest in protecting potential life. Nor is it irrational that Congress has authorized federal reimbursement for medically necessary services generally, but not for certain medically necessary abortions.<sup>[28]</sup> Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures, because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.</p>\\\\n<p>After conducting an extensive evidentiary hearing into issues surrounding the public funding of abortions, the District Court concluded that \\\\\\\"[t]he interests of . . . the federal government . . . in the fetus and in preserving it are not sufficient, weighed in the balance with the woman's threatened health, to justify withdrawing medical assistance unless the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*326</span> woman consents . . . to carry the fetus to term.\\\\\\\" 491 F. Supp., at 737. In making an independent appraisal of the competing interests involved here, the District Court went beyond the judicial function. Such decisions are entrusted under the Constitution to Congress, not the courts. It is the role of the courts only to ensure that congressional decisions comport with the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>Where, as here, the Congress has neither invaded a substantive constitutional right or freedom, nor enacted legislation that purposefully operates to the detriment of a suspect class, the only requirement of equal protection is that congressional action be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. The Hyde Amendment satisfies that standard. It is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy. If that were our mission, not every Justice who has subscribed to the judgment of the Court today could have done so. But we cannot, in the name of the Constitution, overturn duly enacted statutes simply \\\\\\\"because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\\\\\\\" <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U. S. 483, 488, quoted in <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 397 U. S., at 484. Rather, \\\\\\\"when an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated [here] . . ., the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature.\\\\\\\" <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 479.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>For the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold that a State that participates in the Medicaid program is not obligated under Title XIX to continue to fund those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable under the Hyde Amendment. We further hold that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate neither the Fifth Amendment nor the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It is also our view that the appellees <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*327</span> lack standing to raise a challenge to the Hyde Amendment under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>I join the Court's opinion and judgment with these additional remarks.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), held that prior to viability of the fetus, the governmental interest in potential life was insufficient to justify overriding the due process right of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. In the last trimester, however, the State's interest in fetal life was deemed sufficiently strong to warrant a ban on abortions, but only if continuing the pregnancy did not threaten the life or health of the mother. In the latter event, the State was required to respect the choice of the mother to terminate the pregnancy and protect her health.</p>\\\\n<p>Drawing upon <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and the cases that followed it, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent extrapolates the general proposition that the governmental interest in potential life may in no event be pursued at the expense of the mother's health. It then notes that under the Hyde Amendment, Medicaid refuses to fund abortions where carrying to term threatens maternal health but finances other medically indicated procedures, including childbirth. The dissent submits that the Hyde Amendment therefore fails the first requirement imposed by the Fifth Amendment and recognized by the Court's opinion today\\u00c2\\u2014that the challenged official action must serve a legitimate governmental goal, <i>ante,</i> at 324.</p>\\\\n<p>The argument has a certain internal logic, but it is not legally sound. The constitutional right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> was the right to choose to undergo an abortion without coercive interference by the government. As the Court <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*328</span> points out, <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> did not purport to adjudicate a right to have abortions funded by the government, but only to be free from unreasonable official interference with private choice. At an appropriate stage in a pregnancy, for example, abortions could be prohibited to implement the governmental interest in potential life, but in no case to the damage of the health of the mother, whose choice to suffer an abortion rather than risk her health the government was forced to respect.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> thus dealt with the circumstances in which the governmental interest in potential life would justify official interference with the abortion choices of pregnant women. There is no such calculus involved here. The Government does not seek to interfere with or to impose any coercive restraint on the choice of any woman to have an abortion. The woman's choice remains unfettered, the Government is not attempting to use its interest in life to justify a coercive restraint, and hence in disbursing its Medicaid funds it is free to implement rationally what <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> recognized to be its legitimate interest in a potential life by covering the medical costs of childbirth but denying funds for abortions. Neither <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> nor any of the cases decided in its wake invalidates this legislative preference. We decided as much in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), when we rejected the claims that refusing funds for nontherapeutic abortions while defraying the medical costs of childbirth, although not an outright prohibition, nevertheless infringed the fundamental right to choose to terminate a pregnancy by abortion and also violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. I would not abandon <i>Maher</i> and extend <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> to forbid the legislative policy expressed in the Hyde Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>Nor can <i>Maher</i> be successfully distinguished on the ground that it involved only nontherapeutic abortions that the Government was free to place outside the ambit of its Medicaid program. That is not the ground on which <i>Maher</i> proceeded. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*329</span> <i>Maher</i> held that the government need not fund elective abortions because withholding funds rationally furthered the State's legitimate interest in normal childbirth. We sustained this policy even though under <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> the government's interest in fetal life is an inadequate justification for coercive interference with the pregnant woman's right to choose an abortion, whether or not such a procedure is medically indicated. We have already held, therefore, that the interest balancing involved in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> is not controlling in resolving the present constitutional issue. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the straightforward analysis followed in MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S opinion for the Court is sound.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>I agree entirely with my Brother STEVENS that the State's interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus cannot justify the exclusion of financially and medically needy women from the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled solely because the treatment that a doctor has concluded is medically necessary involves an abortion. See <i>post,</i> at 351-352. I write separately to express my continuing disagreement<sup>[1]</sup> with the Court's mischaracterization of the nature of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and its misconception of the manner in which that right is infringed by federal and state legislation withdrawing all funding for medically necessary abortions.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> held that the constitutional right to personal privacy encompasses a woman's decision whether or not to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*330</span> terminate her pregnancy. <i>Roe</i> and its progeny<sup>[2]</sup> established that the pregnant woman has a right to be free from state interference with her choice to have an abortion\\u00c2\\u2014a right which, at least prior to the end of the first trimester, absolutely prohibits any governmental regulation of that highly personal decision.<sup>[3]</sup> The proposition for which these cases stand thus is not that the State is under an affirmative obligation to ensure access to abortions for all who may desire them; it is that the State must refrain from wielding its enormous power and influence in a manner that might burden the pregnant woman's freedom to choose whether to have an abortion. The Hyde Amendment's denial of public funds for medically necessary abortions plainly intrudes upon this constitutionally protected decision, for both by design and in effect it serves to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children that they would otherwise elect not to have.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*331</span> When viewed in the context of the Medicaid program to which it is appended, it is obvious that the Hyde Amendment is nothing less than an attempt by Congress to circumvent the dictates of the Constitution and achieve indirectly what <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> said it could not do directly.<sup>[5]</sup> Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the Federal Government reimburses participating States for virtually all medically necessary services it provides to the categorically needy. The sole limitation of any significance is the Hyde Amendment's prohibition against the use of any federal funds to pay for the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*332</span> costs of abortions (except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term). As my Brother STEVENS persuasively demonstrates, exclusion of medically necessary abortions from Medicaid coverage cannot be justified as a cost-saving device. Rather, the Hyde Amendment is a transparent attempt by the Legislative Branch to impose the political majority's judgment of the morally acceptable and socially desirable preference on a sensitive and intimate decision that the Constitution entrusts to the individual. Worse yet, the Hyde Amendment does not foist that majoritarian viewpoint with equal measure upon everyone in our Nation, rich and poor alike; rather, it imposes that viewpoint only upon that segment of our society which, because of its position of political powerlessness, is least able to defend its privacy rights from the encroachments of state-mandated morality. The instant legislation thus calls for more exacting judicial review than in most other cases. \\\\\\\"When elected leaders cower before public pressure, this Court, more than ever, must not shirk its duty to enforce the Constitution for the benefit of the poor and powerless.\\\\\\\" <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438, 462 (1977) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Though it may not be this Court's mission \\\\\\\"to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 326, it most assuredly is our responsibility to vindicate the pregnant woman's constitutional right to decide whether to bear children free from governmental intrusion.</p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, it is clear that the Hyde Amendment not only was designed to inhibit, but does in fact inhibit the woman's freedom to choose abortion over childbirth. \\\\\\\"Pregnancy is unquestionably a condition requiring medical services. . . . Treatment for the condition may involve medical procedures for its termination, or medical procedures to bring the pregnancy to term, resulting in a live birth. `[A]bortion and childbirth, when stripped of the sensitive moral arguments surrounding the abortion controversy, are simply two alternative <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*333</span> medical methods of dealing with pregnancy. . . .'\\\\\\\" <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe, supra,</i> at 449 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Norton,</i> 408 F. Supp. 660, 663, n. 3 (Conn. 1975)). In every pregnancy, one of these two courses of treatment is medically necessary, and the poverty-stricken woman depends on the Medicaid Act to pay for the expenses associated with that procedure. But under the Hyde Amendment, the Government will fund only those procedures incidental to childbirth. By thus injecting coercive financial incentives favoring childbirth into a decision that is constitutionally guaranteed to be free from governmental intrusion, the Hyde Amendment deprives the indigent woman of her freedom to choose abortion over maternity, thereby impinging on the due process liberty right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The Court's contrary conclusion is premised on its belief that \\\\\\\"[t]he financial constraints that restrict an indigent woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 316. Accurate as this statement may be, it reveals only half the picture. For what the Court fails to appreciate is that it is not simply the woman's indigency that interferes with her freedom of choice, but the combination of her own poverty and the Government's unequal subsidization of abortion and childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>A poor woman in the early stages of pregnancy confronts two alternatives: she may elect either to carry the fetus to term or to have an abortion. In the abstract, of course, this choice is hers alone, and the Court rightly observes that the Hyde Amendment \\\\\\\"places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 315. But the reality of the situation is that the Hyde Amendment has effectively removed this choice from the indigent woman's hands. By funding all of the expenses associated with childbirth and none of the expenses incurred in terminating pregnancy, the Government literally makes an <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*334</span> offer that the indigent woman cannot afford to refuse. It matters not that in this instance the Government has used the carrot rather than the stick. What is critical is the realization that as a practical matter, many poverty-stricken woman will choose to carry their pregnancy to term simply because the Government provides funds for the associated medical services, even though these same women would have chosen to have an abortion if the Government had also paid for that option, or indeed if the Government had stayed out of the picture altogether and had defrayed the costs of neither procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>The fundamental flaw in the Court's due process analysis, then, is its failure to acknowledge that the discriminatory distribution of the benefits of governmental largesse can discourage the exercise of fundamental liberties just as effectively as can an outright denial of those rights through criminal and regulatory sanctions. Implicit in the Court's reasoning is the notion that as long as the Government is not obligated to provide its citizens with certain benefits or privileges, it may condition the grant of such benefits on the recipient's relinquishment of his constitutional rights.</p>\\\\n<p>It would belabor the obvious to expound at any great length on the illegitimacy of a state policy that interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights through the selective bestowal of governmental favors. It suffices to note that we have heretofore never hesitated to invalidate any scheme of granting or withholding financial benefits that incidentally or intentionally burdens one manner of exercising a constitutionally protected choice. To take but one example of many, <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U. S. 398 (1963), involved a South Carolina unemployment insurance statute that required recipients to accept suitable employment when offered, even if the grounds for refusal stemmed from religious convictions. Even though the recipients possessed no entitlement to compensation, the Court held that the State could not cancel the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*335</span> benefits of a Seventh-Day Adventist who had refused a job requiring her to work on Saturdays. The Court's explanation is particularly instructive for the present case:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Here not only is it apparent that appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Nor may the South Carolina court's construction of the statute be saved from constitutional infirmity on the ground that unemployment compensation benefits are not appellant's `right' but merely a `privilege.' It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege. . . . [T]o condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 404-406.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>See also <i>Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co.</i> v. <i>Railroad Comm'n,</i> 271 U. S. 583 (1926); <i>Speiser</i> v. <i>Randall,</i> 357 U. S. 513 (1958); <i>Elfbrandt</i> v. <i>Russell,</i> 384 U. S. 11 (1966); <i>Goldberg</i> v. <i>Kelly,</i> 397 U. S. 254 (1970); <i>U. S.

S. 618 (1969); <i>Memorial Hospital</i> v. <i>Maricopa County,</i> 415 U. S. 250 (1974).</p>\\\\n<p>The Medicaid program cannot be distinguished from these other statutory schemes that unconstitutionally burdened <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*336</span> fundamental rights.<sup>[6]</sup> Here, as in <i>Sherbert,</i> the government withholds financial benefits in a manner that discourages the exercise of a due process liberty: The indigent woman who chooses to assert her constitutional right to have an abortion can do so only on pain of sacrificing health-care benefits to which she would otherwise be entitled. Over 50 years ago, Mr. Justice Sutherland, writing for the Court in <i>Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co.</i> v. <i>Railroad Comm'n, supra,</i> at 593-594, made the following observation, which is as true now as it was then:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"It would be a palpable incongruity to strike down an act of state legislation which, by words of express divestment, seeks to strip the citizen of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, but to uphold an act by <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*337</span> which the same result is accomplished under the guise of a surrender of a right in exchange for a valuable privilege which the state threatens otherwise to withhold. It is not necessary to challenge the proposition that, as a general rule, the state, having power to deny a privilege altogether, may grant it upon such conditions as it sees fit to impose. But the power of the state in that respect is not unlimited; and one of the limitations is that it may not impose conditions which require the relinquishment of constitutional rights. If the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a condition of its favor, it may, in like manner, compel a surrender of all. It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.\\\\\\\"</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>I respectfully dissent.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Three years ago, in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), the Court upheld a state program that excluded nontherapeutic abortions from a welfare program that generally subsidized the medical expenses incidental to pregnancy and childbirth. At that time, I expressed my fear \\\\\\\"that the Court's decisions will be an invitation to public officials, already under extraordinary pressure from well-financed and carefully orchestrated lobbying campaigns, to approve more such restrictions\\\\\\\" on governmental funding for abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 462 (dissenting both in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra</i><i>,</i> and in <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438 (1977), and <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519 (1977)).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*338</span> That fear has proved justified. Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funding is denied for abortions that are medically necessary and that are necessary to avert severe and permanent damage to the health of the mother. The Court's opinion studiously avoids recognizing the undeniable fact that for women eligible for Medicaid\\u00c2\\u2014poor women\\u00c2\\u2014denial of a Medicaid-funded abortion is equivalent to denial of legal abortion altogether. By definition, these women do not have the money to pay for an abortion themselves. If abortion is medically necessary and a funded abortion is unavailable, they must resort to back-alley butchers, attempt to induce an abortion themselves by crude and dangerous methods, or suffer the serious medical consequences of attempting to carry the fetus to term. Because legal abortion is not a realistic option for such women, the predictable result of the Hyde Amendment will be a significant increase in the number of poor women who will die or suffer significant health damage because of an inability to procure necessary medical services.</p>\\\\n<p>The legislation before us is the product of an effort to deny to the poor the constitutional right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), even though the cost may be serious and long-lasting health damage. As my Brother STEVENS has demonstrated, see <i>post,</i> p. 349 (dissenting opinion), the premise underlying the Hyde Amendment was repudiated in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> where the Court made clear that the state interest in protecting fetal life cannot justify jeopardizing the life or health of the mother. The denial of Medicaid benefits to individuals who meet all the statutory criteria for eligibility, solely because the treatment that is medically necessary involves the exercise of the fundamental right to chose abortion, is a form of discrimination repugnant to the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court's decision today marks a retreat from <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and represents a cruel blow to the most powerless members of our society. I dissent.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*339</span> I</h2>\\\\n<p>In its present form, the Hyde Amendment restricts federal funding for abortion to cases in which \\\\\\\"the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service.\\\\\\\" See <i>ante,</i> at 302. Federal funding is thus unavailable even when severe and long-lasting health damage to the mother is a virtual certainty. Nor are federal funds available when severe health damage, or even death, will result to the fetus if it is carried to term.</p>\\\\n<p>The record developed below reveals that the standards set forth in the Hyde Amendment exclude the majority of cases in which the medical profession would recommend abortion as medically necessary. Indeed, in States that have adopted a standard more restrictive than the \\\\\\\"medically necessary\\\\\\\" test of the Medicaid Act, the number of funded abortions has decreased by over 98%. App. 289.</p>\\\\n<p>The impact of the Hyde Amendment on indigent women falls into four major categories. First, the Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funding for abortions that are necessary in order to protect the health and sometimes the life of the mother. Numerous conditions\\u00c2\\u2014such as cancer, rheumatic fever, diabetes, malnutrition, phlebitis, sickle cell anemia, and heart disease\\u00c2\\u2014substantially increase the risks associated with pregnancy or are themselves aggravated by pregnancy. Such conditions may make an abortion medically necessary in the judgment of a physician, but cannot be funded under the Hyde Amendment. Further, the health risks of undergoing an abortion increase dramatically as pregnancy becomes more advanced. By the time a pregnancy has progressed to the point where a physician is able to certify that it endangers the life of the mother, it is in many cases too late to prevent her death because abortion is no <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*340</span> longer safe. There are also instances in which a woman's life will not be immediately threatened by carrying the pregnancy to term, but aggravation of another medical condition will significantly shorten her life expectancy. These cases as well are not fundable under the Hyde Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, federal funding is denied in cases in which severe mental disturbances will be created by unwanted pregnancies. The result of such psychological disturbances may be suicide, attempts at self-abortion, or child abuse. The Hyde Amendment makes no provision for funding in such cases.</p>\\\\n<p>Third, the Hyde Amendment denies funding for the majority of women whose pregnancies have been caused by rape or incest. The prerequisite of a report within 60 days serves to exclude those who are afraid of recounting what has happened or are in fear of unsympathetic treatment by the authorities. Such a requirement is, of course, especially burdensome for the indigent, who may be least likely to be aware that a rapid report to the authorities is indispensable in order for them to be able to obtain an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, federal funding is unavailable in cases in which it is known that the fetus itself will be unable to survive. In a number of situations it is possible to determine in advance that the fetus will suffer an early death if carried to term. The Hyde Amendment, purportedly designed to safeguard \\\\\\\"the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 325, excludes federal funding in such cases.</p>\\\\n<p>An optimistic estimate indicates that as many as 100 excess deaths may occur each year as a result of the Hyde Amendment.<sup>[1]</sup> The record contains no estimate of the health damage that may occur to poor women, but it shows that it will be considerable.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*341</span> II</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court resolves the equal protection issue in this case through a relentlessly formalistic catechism. Adhering to its \\\\\\\"two-tiered\\\\\\\" approach to equal protection, the Court first decides that so-called strict scrutiny is not required because the Hyde Amendment does not violate the Due Process Clause and is not predicated on a constitutionally suspect classification. Therefore, \\\\\\\"the validity of classification must be sustained unless `the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 322 (bracketed material in original), quoting <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 366 U. S. 420, 425 (1961). Observing that previous cases have recognized \\\\\\\"the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 325, the Court concludes that the Hyde Amendment \\\\\\\"establishe[s] incentives that make childbirth a more attractive alternative than abortion for persons eligible for Medicaid,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.,</i> and is therefore rationally related to that governmental interest.</p>\\\\n<p>I continue to believe that the rigid \\\\\\\"two-tiered\\\\\\\" approach is inappropriate and that the Constitution requires a more exacting standard of review than mere rationality in cases such as this one. Further, in my judgment the Hyde Amendment cannot pass constitutional muster even under the rational-basis standard of review.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>This case is perhaps the most dramatic illustration to date of the deficiencies in the Court's obsolete \\\\\\\"two-tiered\\\\\\\" approach to the Equal Protection Clause. See <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist.</i> v. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 411 U. S. 1, 98-110 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); <i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement</i> v. <i>Murgia,</i> 427 U.

S. 93, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*342</span> 113-115 (1979) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).<sup>[3]</sup> With all deference, I am unable to understand how the Court can afford the same level of scrutiny to the legislation involved here\\u00c2\\u2014whose cruel impact falls exclusively on indigent pregnant women\\u00c2\\u2014 that it has given to legislation distinguishing opticians from ophthalmologists, or to other legislation that makes distinctions between economic interests more than able to protect themselves in the political process. See <i>ante,</i> at 326, citing <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U. S. 483 (1955). Heightened scrutiny of legislative classifications has always been designed to protect groups \\\\\\\"saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.\\\\\\\" <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist.</i> v. <i>Rodriguez, supra,</i> at 28.<sup>[4]</sup> And while it is now clear that traditional \\\\\\\"strict scrutiny\\\\\\\" is unavailable to protect the poor against classifications that disfavor them, <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 397 U. S. 471 (1970), I do not believe that legislation that imposes a crushing burden on indigent women can be treated with the same deference given to legislation distinguishing among business interests.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*343</span> B</h2>\\\\n<p>The Hyde Amendment, of course, distinguishes between medically necessary abortions and other medically necessary expenses.<sup>[5]</sup> As I explained in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra</i><i>,</i> such classifications must be assessed by weighing \\\\\\\"`the importance of the governmental benefits denied, the character of the class, and the asserted state interests,'\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 458, quoting <i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement</i> v. <i>Murgia, supra,</i> at 322. Under that approach, the Hyde Amendment is clearly invalid.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>As in <i>Maher,</i> the governmental benefits at issue here are \\\\\\\"of absolutely vital importance in the lives of the recipients.\\\\\\\" <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 458 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). An indigent woman denied governmental funding for a medically necessary abortion is confronted with two grotesque choices. First, she may seek to obtain \\\\\\\"an illegal abortion that poses a serious threat to her health and even her life.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 458. Alternatively, she may attempt to bear the child, a course that may both significantly threaten her health and eliminate any chance she might have had \\\\\\\"to control the direction of her own life,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 459.</p>\\\\n<p>The class burdened by the Hyde Amendment consists of indigent women, a substantial proportion of whom are members of minority races. As I observed in <i>Maher,</i> nonwhite women obtain abortions at nearly double the rate of whites, <i>ibid.</i> In my view, the fact that the burden of the Hyde Amendment falls exclusively on financially destitute women <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*344</span> suggests \\\\\\\"a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\\\\\\\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Carolene Products Co.,</i> 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). For this reason, I continue to believe that \\\\\\\"a showing that state action has a devastating impact on the lives of minority racial groups must be relevant\\\\\\\" for purposes of equal protection analysis. <i>Jefferson</i> v. <i>Hackney,</i> 406 U. S. 535, 575-576 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>As I explained in <i>Maher,</i> the asserted state interest in protecting potential life is insufficient to \\\\\\\"outweigh the deprivation or serious discouragement of a vital constitutional right of especial importance to poor and minority women.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 461. In <i>Maher,</i> the Court found a permissible state interest in encouraging normal childbirth. <i>Id.,</i> at 477-479. The governmental interest in the present case is substantially weaker than in <i>Maher,</i> for under the Hyde Amendment funding is refused even in cases in which normal childbirth will not result: one can scarcely speak of \\\\\\\"normal childbirth\\\\\\\" in cases where the fetus will die shortly after birth, or in which the mother's life will be shortened or her health otherwise gravely impaired by the birth. Nevertheless, the Hyde Amendment denies funding even in such cases. In these circumstances, I am unable to see how even a minimally rational legislature could conclude that the interest in fetal life outweighs the brutal effect of the Hyde Amendment on indigent women. Moreover, both the legislation in <i>Maher</i> and the Hyde Amendment were designed to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion. That purpose is not constitutionally permitted under <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Although I would abandon the strict-scrutiny/rational-basis dichotomy in equal protection analysis, it is by no <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*345</span> means necessary to reject that traditional approach to conclude, as I do, that the Hyde Amendment is a denial of equal protection. My Brother BRENNAN has demonstrated that the Amendment is unconstitutional because it impermissibly infringes upon the individual's constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. See <i>ante,</i> at 332-334 (dissenting opinion). And as my Brother STEVENS demonstrates, see <i>post,</i> at 350-352 (dissenting opinion), the Government's interest in protecting fetal life is not a legitimate one when it is in conflict with \\\\\\\"the preservation of the life or health of the mother,\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 165, and when the Government's effort to make serious health damage to the mother \\\\\\\"a more attractive alternative than abortion,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 325, does not rationally promote the governmental interest in encouraging normal childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court treats this case as though it were controlled by <i>Maher.</i> To the contrary, this case is the mirror image of <i>Maher.</i> The result in <i>Maher</i> turned on the fact that the legislation there under consideration discouraged only non-therapeutic, or medically unnecessary, abortions. In the Court's view, denial of Medicaid funding for nontherapeutic abortions was not a denial of equal protection because Medicaid funds were available only for medically necessary procedures. Thus the plaintiffs were seeking benefits which were not available to others similarly situated. I continue to believe that <i>Maher</i> was wrongly decided. But it is apparent that while the plaintiffs in <i>Maher</i> were seeking a benefit not available to others similarly situated, appellees are protesting their exclusion from a benefit that is available to all others similarly situated. This, it need hardly be said, is a crucial difference for equal protection purposes.</p>\\\\n<p>Under Title XIX and the Hyde Amendment, funding is available for essentially all necessary medical treatment for the poor. Appellees have met the statutory requirements for eligibility, but they are excluded because the treatment that is medically necessary involves the exercise of a fundamental <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*346</span> right, the right to choose an abortion. In short, these appellees have been deprived of a governmental benefit for which they are otherwise eligible, solely because they have attempted to exercise a constitutional right. The interest asserted by the Government, the protection of fetal life, has been declared constitutionally subordinate to appellees' interest in preserving their lives and health by obtaining medically necessary treatment. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i><i>.</i> And finally, the purpose of the legislation was to discourage the exercise of the fundamental right. In such circumstances the Hyde Amendment must be invalidated because it does not meet even the rational-basis standard of review.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The consequences of today's opinion\\u00c2\\u2014consequences to which the Court seems oblivious\\u00c2\\u2014are not difficult to predict. Pregnant women denied the funding necessary to procure abortions will be restricted to two alternatives. First, they can carry the fetus to term\\u00c2\\u2014even though that route may result in severe injury or death to the mother, the fetus, or both. If that course appears intolerable, they can resort to self-induced abortions or attempt to obtain illegal abortions\\u00c2\\u2014 not because bearing a child would be inconvenient, but because it is necessary in order to protect their health.<sup>[7]</sup> The result will not be to protect what the Court describes as \\\\\\\"the legitimate governmental objective of protecting potential life,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 325, but to ensure the destruction of both fetal and maternal life. \\\\\\\"There is another world `out there,' the existence of which the Court . . . either chooses to ignore or fears <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*347</span> to recognize.\\\\\\\" <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S., at 463 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). In my view, it is only by blinding itself to that other world that the Court can reach the result it announces today.</p>\\\\n<p>Ultimately, the result reached today may be traced to the Court's unwillingness to apply the constraints of the Constitution to decisions involving the expenditure of governmental funds. In today's decision, as in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe</i><i>,</i> the Court suggests that a withholding of funding imposes no real obstacle to a woman deciding whether to exercise her constitutionally protected procreative choice, even though the Government is prepared to fund all other medically necessary expenses, including the expenses of childbirth. The Court perceives this result as simply a distinction between a \\\\\\\"limitation on governmental power\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"an affirmative funding obligation.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 318. For a poor person attempting to exercise her \\\\\\\"right\\\\\\\" to freedom of choice, the difference is imperceptible. As my Brother BRENNAN has shown, see <i>ante,</i> at 332-334 (dissenting opinion), the differential distribution of incentives\\u00c2\\u2014which the Court concedes is present here, see <i>ante,</i> at 325\\u00c2\\u2014can have precisely the same effect as an outright prohibition. It is no more sufficient an answer here than it was in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> to say that \\\\\\\"`the appropriate forum'\\\\\\\" for the resolution of sensitive policy choices is the legislature. See <i>ante,</i> at 326, quoting <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe</i><i>,</i> at 479.</p>\\\\n<p>More than 35 years ago, Mr. Justice Jackson observed that the \\\\\\\"task of translating the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights . . . into concrete restraints on officials dealing with the problems of the twentieth century, is one to disturb self-confidence.\\\\\\\" <i>West Virginia State Bd. of Education</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> 319 U. S. 624, 639 (1943). These constitutional principles, he observed for the Court, \\\\\\\"grew in soil which also produced a philosophy that the individual['s] . . . liberty was attainable through mere absence of governmental restraints.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Those principles must be \\\\\\\"transplant[ed] . . . to a soil in which the <i>laissez-faire</i> concept or principle of non-interference <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*348</span> has withered at least as to economic affairs, and social advancements are increasingly sought through closer integration of society and through expanded and strengthened governmental controls.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 640.</p>\\\\n<p>In this case, the Federal Government has taken upon itself the burden of financing practically all medically necessary expenditures. One category of medically necessary expenditure has been singled out for exclusion, and the sole basis for the exclusion is a premise repudiated for purposes of constitutional law in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> The consequence is a devastating impact on the lives and health of poor women. I do not believe that a Constitution committed to the equal protection of the laws can tolerate this result. I dissent.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>I join the dissent of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and agree wholeheartedly with his and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' respective observations and descriptions of what the Court is doing in this latest round of \\\\\\\"abortion cases.\\\\\\\" I need add only that I find what I said in dissent in <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438, 462 (1977), and its two companion cases, <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), and <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519 (1977), continues for me to be equally pertinent and equally applicable in these Hyde Amendment cases. There is \\\\\\\"condescension\\\\\\\" in the Court's holding that \\\\\\\"she may go elsewhere for her abortion\\\\\\\"; this is \\\\\\\"disingenuous and alarming\\\\\\\"; the Government \\\\\\\"punitively impresses upon a needy minority its own concepts of the socially desirable, the publicly acceptable, and the morally sound\\\\\\\"; the \\\\\\\"financial argument, of course, is specious\\\\\\\"; there truly is \\\\\\\"another world 'out there,' the existence of which the Court, I suspect, either chooses to ignore <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*349</span> or fears to recognize\\\\\\\"; the \\\\\\\"cancer of poverty will continue to grow\\\\\\\"; and \\\\\\\"the lot of the poorest among us,\\\\\\\" once again, and still, is not to be bettered.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially. The concept of equal justice under law is served by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\\\\\\" <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Mow Sun Wong,</i> 426 U. S. 88, 100. When the sovereign provides a special benefit or a special protection for a class of persons, it must define the membership in the class by neutral criteria; it may not make special exceptions for reasons that are constitutionally insufficient.</p>\\\\n<p>These cases involve the pool of benefits that Congress created by enacting Title XIX of the Social Security Act in 1965. Individuals who satisfy two neutral statutory criteria\\u00c2\\u2014 financial need and medical need\\u00c2\\u2014are entitled to equal access to that pool. The question is whether certain persons who satisfy those criteria may be denied access to benefits solely because they must exercise the constitutional right to have an abortion in order to obtain the medical care they need. Our prior cases plainly dictate the answer to that question.</p>\\\\n<p>A fundamentally different question was decided in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464. Unlike these plaintiffs, the plaintiffs in <i>Maher</i> did not satisfy the neutral criterion of medical need; they sought a subsidy for nontherapeutic abortions\\u00c2\\u2014 medical procedures which by definition they did not need. In rejecting that claim, the Court held that their constitutional right to choose that procedure did not impose a duty on <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*350</span> the State to subsidize the exercise of that right. Nor did the fact that the State had undertaken to pay for the necessary medical care associated with childbirth require the State also to pay for abortions that were not necessary; for only necessary medical procedures satisfied the neutral statutory criteria. Nontherapeutic abortions were simply outside the ambit of the medical benefits program. Thus, in <i>Maher,</i> the plaintiffs' desire to exercise a constitutional right gave rise to neither special access nor special exclusion from the pool of benefits created by Title XIX.</p>\\\\n<p>These cases involve a special exclusion of women who, by definition, are confronted with a choice between two serious harms: serious health damage to themselves on the one hand and abortion on the other. The competing interests are the interest in maternal health and the interest in protecting potential human life. It is now part of our law that the pregnant woman's decision as to which of these conflicting interests shall prevail is entitled to constitutional protection.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, the Court recognized that the States have a legitimate and protectible interest in potential human life. 410 U. S., at 162. But the Court explicitly held that prior to fetal viability that interest may not justify any governmental burden on the woman's choice to have an abortion<sup>[2]</sup> nor even any <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*351</span> regulation of abortion except in furtherance of the State's interest in the woman's health. In effect, the Court held that a woman's freedom to elect to have an abortion prior to viability has absolute constitutional protection, subject only to valid health regulations. Indeed, in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> the Court held that even after fetal viability, a State may \\\\\\\"regulate, and even proscribe, abortion <i>except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" Id.,</i> at 165 (emphasis added). We have a duty to respect that holding. The Court simply shirks that duty in this case.</p>\\\\n<p>If a woman has a constitutional right to place a higher value on avoiding either serious harm to her own health or perhaps an abnormal childbirth<sup>[3]</sup> than on protecting potential life, the exercise of that right cannot provide the basis for the denial of a benefit to which she would otherwise be entitled. The Court's sterile equal protection analysis evades this critical though simple point. The Court focuses exclusively on the \\\\\\\"legitimate interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 324. It concludes that since the Hyde Amendments further that interest, the exclusion they create is rational and therefore constitutional. But it is misleading <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*352</span> to speak of the Government's legitimate interest in the fetus without reference to the context in which that interest was held to be legitimate. For <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> squarely held that the States may not protect that interest when a conflict with the interest in a pregnant woman's health exists. It is thus perfectly clear that neither the Federal Government nor the States may exclude a woman from medical benefits to which she would otherwise be entitled solely to further an interest in potential life when a physician, \\\\\\\"in appropriate medical judgment,\\\\\\\" certifies that an abortion is necessary \\\\\\\"for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 165. The Court totally fails to explain why this reasoning is not dispositive here.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*353</span> It cannot be denied that the harm inflicted upon women in the excluded class is grievous.<sup>[5]</sup> As the Court's comparison of the differing forms of the Hyde Amendment that have <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*354</span> been enacted since 1976 demonstrates, the Court expressly approves the exclusion of benefits in \\\\\\\"instances where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother\\\\\\\" is the predictable consequence of carrying the pregnancy to term. Indeed, as the Solicitor General acknowledged with commendable candor, the logic of the Court's position would justify a holding that it would be constitutional to deny funding to a medically and financially needy person even if abortion were the only lifesaving medical procedure available.<sup>[6]</sup> Because a denial of benefits for medically necessary abortions inevitably causes serious harm to the excluded women, it is tantamount to severe punishment.<sup>[7]</sup> In my judgment, that denial cannot be justified unless government may, in effect, punish women who want abortions. But as the Court unequivocally held in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> this the government may not do.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*355</span> Nor can it be argued that the exclusion of this type of medically necessary treatment of the indigent can be justified on fiscal grounds. There are some especially costly forms of treatment that may reasonably be excluded from the program in order to preserve the assets in the pool and extend its benefits to the maximum number of needy persons. Fiscal considerations may compel certain difficult choices in order to improve the protection afforded to the entire benefited class.<sup>[8]</sup> But, ironically, the exclusion of medically necessary abortions harms the entire class as well as its specific victims. For the records in both <i>McRae</i> and <i>Zbaraz</i> demonstrate that the cost of an abortion is only a small fraction of the costs associated with childbirth.<sup>[9]</sup> Thus, the decision to tolerate harm to indigent <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*356</span> persons who need an abortion in order to avoid \\\\\\\"serious and long-lasting health damage\\\\\\\" is one that is financed by draining money out of the pool that is used to fund all other necessary medical procedures. Unlike most invidious classifications, this discrimination harms not only its direct victims but also the remainder of the class of needy persons that the pool was designed to benefit.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Maher</i> the Court stated:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigents. But when a State decides to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty by providing medical care, the manner in which it dispenses benefits is subject to constitutional limitations.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 469-470 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Having decided to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty by providing necessary medical care, the government must use neutral criteria in distributing benefits. It may not deny benefits to a financially and medically needy person simply because he is a Republican, a Catholic, or an Oriental\\u00c2\\u2014 or because he has spoken against a program the government has a legitimate interest in furthering. In sum, it may not create exceptions for the sole purpose of furthering a governmental interest that is constitutionally subordinate to the individual interest that the entire program was designed to protect. The Hyde Amendments not only exclude financially and medically needy persons from the pool of benefits for a constitutionally insufficient reason; they also require the expenditure of millions and millions of dollars in order to thwart the exercise of a constitutional right, thereby effectively inflicting serious and long-lasting harm on impoverished women who want and need abortions for valid medical reasons. In my judgment, these Amendments constitute an unjustifiable, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*357</span> and indeed blatant, violation of the sovereign's duty to govern impartially.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed by <i>John T.

Supp. 630.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  The District Court found no Establishment Clause infirmity because, in its view, the Hyde Amendment has a secular legislative purpose, its principal effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and it does not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  The District Court also apparently concluded that the Hyde Amendment operates to the disadvantage of a \\\\\\\"suspect class,\\\\\\\" namely, teenage women desiring medically necessary abortions. See n. 26, <i>infra.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[10]  Although the original class included only those pregnant women in the first two trimesters of their pregnancy, the recertified class included all pregnant women regardless of the stage of their pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  The appellees argue that their interpretation of Title XIX finds support in <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438. There the Court considered the question whether Title XIX permits a participating State to exclude <i>non</i>-therapeutic abortions from its Medicaid plan. Although concluding that Title XIX does not preclude a State's refusal \\\\\\\"to fund <i>unnecessary</i>\\u00c2\\u2014though perhaps desirable\\u00c2\\u2014medical services,\\\\\\\" the Court observed that \\\\\\\"serious statutory questions might be presented if a state Medicaid plan excluded necessary medical treatment from its coverage.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 444-445 (emphasis in original). The Court in <i>Beal,</i> however, did not address the possible effect of the Hyde Amendment upon the operation of Title XIX.</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  In <i>Preterm, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukakis,</i> 591 F. 2d 121, 132 (CA1 1979), the opinion of the court by Judge Coffin noted:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The Medicaid program is one of federal and state cooperation in funding medical assistance; a complete withdrawal of the federal prop in the system with the intent to drop the total cost of providing the service upon the states, runs directly counter to the basic structure of the program and could seriously cripple a state's attempts to provide other necessary medical services embraced by its plan.\\\\\\\" (Footnote omitted.)</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  When subsequent Congresses have deviated from the original structure of Title XIX by obligating a participating State to assume the full costs of a service as a prerequisite for continued federal funding of other services, they have always expressed their intent to do so in unambiguous terms. See <i>Zbaraz</i> v. <i>Quern,</i> 596 F. 2d 196, 200, n. 12 (CA7 1979).</p>\\\\n<p>[14]  Since Title XIX itself provides for variations in the required coverage of state Medicaid plans depending on changes in the availability of federal reimbursement, we need not inquire, as the District Court did, whether the Hyde Amendment is a substantive amendment to Title XIX. The present case is thus different from <i>TVA</i> v. <i>Hill,</i> 437 U. S. 153, 189-193, where the issue was whether continued appropriations for the Tellico Dam impliedly repealed the substantive requirements of the Endangered Species Act prohibiting the continued construction of the Dam because it threatened the natural habitat of an endangered species.</p>\\\\n<p>[15]  Our conclusion that the Congress that enacted Title XIX did not intend a participating State to assume a unilateral funding obligation for any health service in an approved Medicaid plan is corroborated by the fact that subsequent Congresses simply assumed that the withdrawal of federal funding under the Hyde Amendment for certain medically necessary abortions would relieve a participating State of any obligation to provide for such services in its Medicaid plan. See the cases cited in the text, <i>supra.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[16]  A participating State is free, if it so chooses, to include in its Medicaid plan those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable. See <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S., at 447; <i>Preterm, Inc.</i> v. <i>Dukakis, supra,</i> at 134. We hold only that a State <i>need</i> not include such abortions in its Medicaid plan.</p>\\\\n<p>[17]  The appellees also argue that the Hyde Amendment is unconstitutionally vague insofar as physicians are unable to understand or implement the exceptions in the Hyde Amendment under which abortions are reimbursable. It is our conclusion, however, that the Hyde Amendment is not void for vagueness because (1) the sanction provision in the Medicaid Act contains a clear scienter requirement under which good-faith errors are not penalized, see <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 395, and, (2), in any event, the exceptions in the Hyde Amendment \\\\\\\"are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest.\\\\\\\" <i>Broadrick</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 413 U. S. 601, 608.</p>\\\\n<p>[18]  The Court in <i>Wade</i> observed that previous decisions of this Court had recognized that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause \\\\\\\"has some extension to activities relating to marriage, <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967); procreation, <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 316 U. S. 535, 541-542 (1942); contraception, <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S.

S. 390, 399 (1923)].\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 152-153.</p>\\\\n<p>[19]  The appellees argue that the Hyde Amendment is unconstitutional because it \\\\\\\"penalizes\\\\\\\" the exercise of a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy by abortion. See <i>Memorial Hospital</i> v. <i>Maricopa County,</i> 415 U. S. 250; <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 394 U. S. 618. This argument falls short of the mark. In <i>Maher,</i> the Court found only a \\\\\\\"semantic difference\\\\\\\" between the argument that Connecticut's refusal to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions \\\\\\\"unduly interfere[d]\\\\\\\" with the exercise of the constitutional liberty recognized in <i>Wade</i> and the argument that it \\\\\\\"penalized\\\\\\\" the exercise of that liberty. 432 U. S., at 474, n. 8. And, regardless of how the claim was characterized, the <i>Maher</i> Court rejected the argument that Connecticut's refusal to subsidize protected conduct, without more, impinged on the constitutional freedom of choice. This reasoning is equally applicable in the present case. A substantial constitutional question would arise if Congress had attempted to withhold all Medicaid benefits from an otherwise eligible candidate simply because that candidate had exercised her constitutionally protected freedom to terminate her pregnancy by abortion. This would be analogous to <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U. S. 398, where this Court held that a State may not, consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, withhold <i>all</i> unemployment compensation benefits from a claimant who would otherwise be eligible for such benefits but for the fact that she is unwilling to work one day per week on her Sabbath. But the Hyde Amendment, unlike the statute at issue in <i>Sherbert,</i> does not provide for such a broad disqualification from receipt of public benefits. Rather, the Hyde Amendment, like the Connecticut welfare provision at issue in <i>Maher,</i> represents simply a refusal to subsidize certain protected conduct. A refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of a \\\\\\\"penalty\\\\\\\" on that activity.</p>\\\\n<p>[20]  As this Court in <i>Maher</i> observed: \\\\\\\"The Constitution imposes no obligation on the [government] to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigents.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 469.</p>\\\\n<p>[21]  Since the constitutional entitlement of a physician who administers medical care to an indigent woman is no broader than that of his patient, see <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 604, and n. 33, we also reject the appellees' claim that the funding restrictions of the Hyde Amendment violate the due process rights of the physician who advises a Medicaid recipient to obtain a medically necessary abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>[22]  The remaining named appellees, including the individual physicians and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp., did not attack the Hyde Amendment on the basis of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>[23]  These named appellees sued on behalf of the class of \\\\\\\"women of all religious and nonreligious persuasions and beliefs who have, in accordance with the teaching of their religion and/or the dictates of their conscience determined that an abortion is necessary.\\\\\\\" But since we conclude below that the named appellees have not established their own standing to sue, \\\\\\\"[t]hey cannot represent a class of whom they are not a part.\\\\\\\" <i>Bailey</i> v. <i>Patterson,</i> 369 U. S. 31, 32-33. See also <i>O'Shea</i> v. <i>Littleton,</i> 414 U. S. 488, 494-495.</p>\\\\n<p>[24]  For example, in <i>Board of Education</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 392 U. S. 236, 249, the Court found no free exercise violation since the plaintiffs had \\\\\\\"not contended that the [statute in question] in any way coerce[d] them <i>as individuals</i> in the practice of their religion.\\\\\\\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\\\\n<p>[25]  An exception to this statement is to be found in <i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims,</i> 377 U. S. 533, and its progeny. Although the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right to vote in state elections, see <i>Minor</i> v. <i>Happersett,</i> 21 Wall. 162, 178, <i>Reynolds</i> held that if a State adopts an electoral system, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment confers upon a qualified voter a substantive right to participate in the electoral process equally with other qualified voters. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Dunn</i> v. <i>Blumstein,</i> 405 U. S. 330, 336.</p>\\\\n<p>[26]  Although the matter is not free from doubt, the District Court seems to have concluded that teenage women desiring medically necessary abortions constitute a \\\\\\\"suspect class\\\\\\\" for purposes of triggering a heightened level of equal protection scrutiny. In this regard, the District Court observed that the Hyde Amendment \\\\\\\"clearly operate[s] to the disadvantage of one suspect class, that is to the disadvantage of the statutory class of adolescents at a high risk of pregnancy . . . , and particularly those seventeen and under.\\\\\\\" 491 F. Supp., at 738. The \\\\\\\"statutory\\\\\\\" class to which the District Court was referring is derived from the Adolescent Health Services and Pregnancy Prevention and Care Act, 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 300a-21 <i>et seq.</i> (1976 ed., Supp. II). It was apparently the view of the District Court that since statistics indicate that women under 21 years of age are disproportionately represented among those for whom an abortion is medically necessary, the Hyde Amendment invidiously discriminates against teenage women.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>But the Hyde Amendment is facially neutral as to age, restricting funding for abortions for women of all ages. The District Court erred, therefore, in relying solely on the disparate impact of the Hyde Amendment in concluding that it discriminated on the basis of age. The equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment prohibits only purposeful discrimination, <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 426 U. S. 229, and when a facially neutral federal statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, it is incumbent upon the challenger to prove that Congress \\\\\\\"selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\\\\\\\" <i>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</i> v. <i>Feeney,</i> 442 U. S. 256, 279. There is no evidence to support such a finding of intent in the present case.</p>\\\\n<p>[27]  We address here the constitutionality of the most restrictive version of the Hyde Amendment, namely, that applicable in fiscal year 1976 under which federal funds were unavailable for abortions \\\\\\\"except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.\\\\\\\" Three versions of the Hyde Amendment are at issue in this case. If the most restrictive version is constitutionally valid, so too are the others.</p>\\\\n<p>[28]  In fact, abortion is not the only \\\\\\\"medically necessary\\\\\\\" service for which federal funds under Medicaid are sometimes unavailable to otherwise eligible claimants. See 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1396d (a) (17) (B) (inpatient hospital care of patients between 21 and 65 in institutions for tuberculosis or mental disease not covered by Title XIX).</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  [This opinion applies also to No. 79-4, <i>Williams et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> No. 79-5, <i>Miller, Acting Director, Illinois Department of Public Aid, et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> and No. 79-491, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al., post,</i> p. 358.]</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  See <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, 482-490 (1977) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  <i>E. g., </i><i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976); <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff,</i> 428 U. S. 106 (1976); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (1979); cf. <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977).</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  After the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the mother's health, may regulate the abortion <i>procedure</i> in ways that are reasonably related to that end. And even after the point of viability is reached, state regulation in furtherance of its interest in the potentiality of human life may not go so far as to proscribe abortions that are necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. See <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 164-165 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  My focus throughout this opinion is upon the coercive impact of the congressional decision to fund one outcome of pregnancy\\u00c2\\u2014childbirth\\u00c2\\u2014 while not funding the other\\u00c2\\u2014abortion. Because I believe this alone renders the Hyde Amendment unconstitutional, I do not dwell upon the other disparities that the Amendment produces in the treatment of rich and poor, pregnant and nonpregnant. I concur completely, however, in my Brother STEVENS' discussion of those disparities. Specifically, I agree that the congressional decision to fund all medically necessary procedures except for those that require an abortion is entirely irrational either as a means of allocating health-care resources or otherwise serving legitimate social welfare goals. And that irrationality in turn exposes the Amendment for what it really is\\u00c2\\u2014a deliberate effort to discourage the exercise of a constitutionally protected right.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>It is important to put this congressional decision in human terms. Nonpregnant women may be reimbursed for all medically necessary treatments. Pregnant women with analogous ailments, however, will be reimbursed only if the treatment involved does not happen to include an abortion. Since the refusal to fund will in some significant number of cases force the patient to forgo medical assistance, the result is to refuse treatment for some genuine maladies not because they need not be treated, cannot be treated, or are too expensive to treat, and not because they relate to a deliberate choice to abort a pregnancy, but merely because treating them would as a practical matter require termination of that pregnancy. Even were one of the view that legislative hostility to abortions could justify a decision to fund obstetrics and child delivery services while refusing to fund nontherapeutic abortions, the present statutory scheme could not be saved. For here, that hostility has gone a good deal farther. Its consequence is to leave indigent sick women without treatment simply because of the medical fortuity that their illness cannot be treated unless their pregnancy is terminated. Antipathy to abortion, in short, has been permitted not only to ride roughshod over a woman's constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy in the fashion she chooses, but also to distort our Nation's health-care programs. As a means of delivering health services, then, the Hyde Amendment is completely irrational. As a means of preventing abortions, it is concededly rational\\u00c2\\u2014 brutally so. But this latter goal is constitutionally forbidden.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  Cf. <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff, supra,</i> at 118-119, n. 7:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"For a doctor who cannot afford to work for nothing, and a woman who cannot afford to pay him, the State's refusal to fund an abortion is as effective an `interdiction' of it as would ever be necessary.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  The Court rather summarily rejects the argument that the Hyde Amendment unconstitutionally penalizes the woman's exercise of her right to choose an abortion with the comment that \\\\\\\"[a] refusal to fund protected activity, without more, cannot be equated with the imposition of a `penalty' on that activity.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 317, n. 19. To begin with, the Court overlooks the fact that there is \\\\\\\"more\\\\\\\" than a simple refusal to fund a protected activity in this case; instead, there is a program that selectively funds but one of two choices of a constitutionally protected decision, thereby penalizing the election of the disfavored option.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, it is no answer to assert that no \\\\\\\"penalty\\\\\\\" is being imposed because the State is only refusing to pay for the specific costs of the protected activity rather than withholding other Medicaid benefits to which the recipient would be entitled or taking some other action more readily characterized as \\\\\\\"punitive.\\\\\\\" Surely the Government could not provide free transportation to the polling booths only for those citizens who vote for Democratic candidates, even though the failure to provide the same benefit to Republicans \\\\\\\"represents simply a refusal to subsidize certain protected conduct,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.,</i> and does not involve the denial of any other governmental benefits. Whether the State withholds only the special costs of a disfavored option or penalizes the individual more broadly for the manner in which she exercises her choice, it cannot interfere with a constitutionally protected decision through the coercive use of governmental largesse.</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  [This opinion applies also to No. 79-4, <i>Williams et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> No. 79-5, <i>Miller, Acting Director, Illinois Department of Public Aid, et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> and No. 79-491, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al., post,</i> p. 358.]</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  See App. 294-296.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  For example, the number of serious complications deriving from abortions was estimated to be about 100 times the number of deaths from abortions. See <i>id.,</i> at 200.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  A number of individual Justices have expressed discomfort with the two-tiered approach, and I am pleased to observe that its hold on the law may be waning. See <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren,</i> 429 U. S. 190, 210-211, and n.[*] (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring); <i>id.,</i> at 211-212 (STEVENS, J., concurring); <i>post,</i> at 352, n. 4 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Further, the Court has adopted an \\\\\\\"intermediate\\\\\\\" level of scrutiny for a variety of classifications. See <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Gordon,</i> 430 U. S. 762 (1977) (illegitimacy); <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren, supra</i> (sex discrimination); <i>Foley</i> v. <i>Connelie,</i> 435 U. S. 291 (1978) (alienage). Cf. <i>University of California Regents</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265, 324 (1978) (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ.) (affirmative action).</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  For this reason the Court has on occasion suggested that classifications discriminating against the poor are subject to special scrutiny under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. See <i>McDonald</i> v. <i>Board of Election,</i> 394 U. S. 802, 807 (1969); <i>Harper</i> v. <i>Virginia Bd. of Elections,</i> 383 U. S. 663, 668 (1966).</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  As my Brother STEVENS suggests, see <i>post,</i> at 355, n. 8 (dissenting opinion), the denial of funding for those few medically necessary services that are excluded from the Medicaid program is based on a desire to conserve federal funds, not on a desire to penalize those who suffer the excluded disabilities.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  In practical effect, my approach is not in this context dissimilar to that taken in <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren, supra,</i> at 197, where the Court referred to an intermediate standard of review requiring that classifications \\\\\\\"must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  Of course, some poor women will attempt to raise the funds necessary to obtain a lawful abortion. A court recently found that those who were fortunate enough to do so had to resort to \\\\\\\"not paying rent or utility bills, pawning household goods, diverting food and clothing money, or journeying to another state to obtain lower rates or fraudulently use a relative's insurance policy. . . . [S]ome patients were driven to theft.\\\\\\\" <i>Women's Health Services, Inc.</i> v. <i>Maher,</i> 482 F. Supp. 725, 731, n. 9.</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  [This opinion applies also to No. 79-4, <i>Williams et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> No. 79-5, <i>Miller, Acting Director, Illinois Department of Public Aid, et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> and No. 79-491, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al., post,</i> p. 358.]</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  [This opinion applies also to No. 79-4, <i>Williams et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> No. 79-5, <i>Miller, Acting Director, Illinois Department of Public Aid, et al.</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al.,</i> and No. 79-491, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Zbaraz et al., post,</i> p. 358.]</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  \\\\\\\"In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, the Court held that a woman's right to decide whether to abort a pregnancy is entitled to constitutional protection. That decision . . . is now part of our law. . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 101 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> involved Texas statutes making it a crime to \\\\\\\"procure an abortion,\\\\\\\" except when attempted to save the pregnant woman's life. 410 U. S., at 117-118. <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i> involved the somewhat less onerous Georgia statutes making abortion a crime in most circumstances, the exceptions being abortions to save the pregnant woman from life or permanent health endangerment, cases in which there was a very likely irremediable birth defect in the child, and cases in which the pregnancy was the result of rape. Those exceptions were subject to burdensome prior medical approvals, which were held to be unconstitutional. Subsequent cases have invalidated other burdens on the pregnant woman's free choice to abort. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth, supra</i> (consent required of husband or, for an unmarried woman under 18, of a parent); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (consent required of either parent or superior court judge for an unmarried woman under 18).</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The Court rests heavily on the premise\\u00c2\\u2014recognized in both <i>Roe</i> and <i>Maher</i>\\u00c2\\u2014that the State's legitimate interest in preserving potential life provides a sufficient justification for funding medical services that are necessarily associated with normal childbirth without also funding abortions that are not medically necessary. The <i>Maher</i> opinion repeatedly referred to the policy of favoring \\\\\\\"normal childbirth.\\\\\\\" See 432 U. S., at 477, 478, 479. But this case involves a refusal to fund abortions which are medically necessary to avoid abnormal childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  These cases thus illustrate the flaw in the method of equal protection analysis by which one chooses among alternative \\\\\\\"levels of scrutiny\\\\\\\" and then determines whether the extent to which a particular legislative measure furthers a given governmental objective transcends the predetermined threshold. See <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren,</i> 429 U. S. 190, 211-212 (STEVENS, J., concurring). That method may simply bypass the real issue. The relevant question in these cases is whether the Court must attach greater weight to the individual's interest in being included in the class than to the governmental interest in keeping the individual out. Since <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> squarely held that the individual interest in the freedom to elect an abortion and the state interest in protecting maternal health <i>both</i> outweigh the State's interest in protecting potential life prior to viability, the Court's \\\\\\\"equal protection analysis\\\\\\\" is doubly erroneous.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>In responding to my analysis of this case, MR. JUSTICE WHITE has described the constitutional right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> as \\\\\\\"the right to choose to undergo an abortion without coercive interference by the government\\\\\\\" or a right \\\\\\\"only to be free from unreasonable official interference with private choice.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 327, 328. No such language is found in the <i>Roe</i> opinion itself. Rather, that case squarely held that state interference is unreasonable if it attaches a greater importance to the interest in potential life than to the interest in protecting the mother's health. One could with equal justification describe the right protected by the First Amendment as the right to make speeches without coercive interference by the government and then sustain a government subsidy for all medically needy persons except those who publicly advocate a change of administration.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  The record is replete with examples of serious physical harm. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Judge Dooling's opinion in <i>McRae</i> v. <i>Califano,</i> 491 F. Supp. 630, 670:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Women, particularly young women, suffering from diabetes are likely to experience high risks of health damage to themselves and their fetuses; the woman may become blind through the worsening during pregnancy of a diabetic retinopathy; in the case, particularly, of the juvenile diabetic, Dr. Eliot testified there is evidence that a series of pregnancies advances the diabetes faster; given an aggravated diabetic condition, other risks increased through pregnancy are kidney problems, and vascular problems of the extremities.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>See also the affidavit of Jane Doe in No. 79-1268:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"3. I am 25 years old. I am married with four living children. Following the birth of my third child in November of 1976, I developed a serious case of phlebitis from which I have not completely recovered. Carrying another pregnancy to term would greatly aggravate this condition and increase the risk of blood clots to the lung.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"4. On July 29, 1977, I went to the Fertility Control Clinic at St. Paul-Ramsey Hospital, St. Paul, Minnesota to request an abortion. They informed me that a new law prohibits any federal reimbursement for abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother and that they cannot afford to do this operation free for me.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"5. I cannot afford to pay for an abortion myself, and without Medicaid reimbursement, I cannot obtain a safe, legal abortion. According to the doctor, Dr. Jane E. Hodgson, without an abortion I might suffer serious and permanent health problems.\\\\\\\" App. in No. 79-1268, pp. 109-110.</p>\\\\n<p>And see the case of the Jane Doe in Nos. 79-4, 79-5, and 79-491, as recounted in Dr. Zbaraz' affidavit:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Jane Doe is 38 years old and has had nine previous pregnancies. She has a history of varicose veins and thrombophlebitis (blood clots) of the left leg. The varicose veins can be, and in her case were, caused by multiple pregnancies: the weight of the uterus on her pelvic veins increased the blood pressure in the veins of her lower extremities; those veins dilated and her circulation was impaired, resulting in thrombophlebitis of her left leg. The varicosities of her lower extremities became so severe that they required partial surgical removal in 1973.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"2. Given this medical history, Jane Doe's varicose veins are almost certain to recur if she continues her pregnancy. Such a recurrence would require a second operative procedure for their removal. Given her medical history, there is also about a 30% risk that her thrombophlebitis will recur during the pregnancy in the form of `deep vein' thrombophlebitis (the surface veins of her left leg having previously been partially removed). This condition would impair circulation and might require prolonged hospitalization with bed rest.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"3. Considering Jane Doe's medical history of varicose veins and thrombophlebitis, particularly against the background of her age and multiple pregnancies, it is my view that an abortion is medically necessary for her, though not necessary to preserve her life.\\\\\\\" App. in Nos. 79-4, 79-5, and 79-491, p. 92.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  \\\\\\\"QUESTION: Mr. Solicitor General, would you make the same rational basis argument if the Hyde amendment did not contain the exception for endangering the life of the mother, if it was her death rather than adverse impact on her health that was involved?\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Mr. McCREE: I think I would.\\\\\\\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in 79-1268, p. 10.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  In this respect, these cases are entirely different from <i>Maher,</i> in which the Court repeatedly noted that the refusal to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions would merely result in normal childbirth. Surely the government may properly presume that no harm will ensue from normal childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  This rationale may satisfactorily explain the exclusions from the Medicaid program noted by the Court. <i>Ante,</i> at 325, n. 28. In all events, it is safe to assume that those exclusions would conserve the assets of the pool.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  In the <i>Zbaraz</i> case, Judge Grady found that the average cost to the State of Illinois of an abortion was less than $150 as compared with the cost of a childbirth which exceeded $1,350. App. to Juris. Statement in No. 79-491, p. 14a, n. 8.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>Indeed, based on an estimated cost of providing support to children of indigent parents together with their estimate of the number of medically necessary abortions that would be funded but for the Hyde Amendment, appellees in the <i>Zbaraz</i> case contend that in the State of Illinois alone the effect of the Hyde Amendment is to impose a cost of about $20,000,000 per year on the public fise. Brief for Appellees in Nos. 79-4, 79-5, and 79-491, p. 60, n.</p>\\\\n<p>See also Judge Dooling's conclusion:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"While the debate [on the Hyde Amendment] in both years was on a rider to the departmental appropriations bill, it was quickly established that the restriction on abortion funding was not an economy measure; it was recognized that if an abortion was not performed for a medicaid eligible woman, the medicaid and other costs of childbearing and nurture would greatly exceed the cost of abortion. Opponents of funding restriction were equally at pains, however, to make clear that they did not favor funding abortion as a means of reducing the Government's social welfare costs.\\\\\\\" 491 F.

Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(2)-(7) (1988), provides, with certain exceptions, that no abortion shall be performed on a woman under 18 years of age until at least 48 hours after both of her parents have been notified. In subdivisions 2-4 of the statute the notice is mandatory unless (1) the attending physician certifies that an immediate abortion is necessary to prevent the woman's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice; (2) both of her parents have consented in writing; or (3) the woman declares that she is a victim of parental abuse or neglect, in which event notice of her declaration must be given to the proper authorities. The United States Court of Appeals for the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*423</span> Eighth Circuit, sitting en banc, unanimously held these provisions unconstitutional. In No. 88-1309, we granted the State's petition to review that holding. Subdivision 6 of the same statute provides that if a court enjoins the enforcement of subdivision 2, the same notice requirement shall be effective unless the pregnant woman obtains a court order permitting the abortion to proceed. By a vote of 7 to 3, the Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of subdivision 6. In No. 88-1125, we granted the plaintiffs' petition to review that holding.</p>\\\\n<p>For reasons that follow, we now conclude that the requirement of notice to both of the pregnant minor's parents is not reasonably related to legitimate state interests and that subdivision 2 is unconstitutional. A different majority of the Court, for reasons stated in separate opinions, concludes that subdivision 6 is constitutional. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety is affirmed.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>The parental notice statute was enacted in 1981 as an amendment to the Minors' Consent to Health Services Act. The earlier statute, which remains in effect as subdivision 1 of \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343 and as \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.346, had modified the common-law requirement of parental consent for any medical procedure performed on minors. It authorized \\\\\\\"[a]ny minor\\\\\\\" to give effective consent without any parental involvement for the treatment of \\\\\\\"pregnancy and conditions associated therewith, venereal disease, alcohol and other drug abuse.\\\\\\\"<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*424</span> The statute, unlike others of its age,<sup>[2]</sup> applied to abortion services.</p>\\\\n<p>The 1981 amendment qualified the authority of an \\\\\\\"unemancipated minor\\\\\\\"<sup>[3]</sup> to give effective consent to an abortion by requiring that either her physician or an agent notify \\\\\\\"the parent\\\\\\\" personally or by certified mail at least 48 hours before the procedure is performed.<sup>[4]</sup> The term \\\\\\\"parent\\\\\\\" is defined in subdivision 3 to mean \\\\\\\"both parents of the pregnant woman if they are both living.\\\\\\\" No exception is made for <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*425</span> a divorced parent, a noncustodial parent, or a biological parent who never married or lived with the pregnant woman's mother.<sup>[5]</sup> The statute does provide, however, that if only one parent is living, or \\\\\\\"if the second one cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort,\\\\\\\" notice to one parent is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*426</span> sufficient.<sup>[6]</sup> It also makes exceptions for cases in which emergency treatment prior to notice \\\\\\\"is necessary to prevent the woman's death,\\\\\\\" both parents have already given their consent in writing, or the proper authorities are advised that the minor is a victim of sexual or physical abuse.<sup>[7]</sup> The statute subjects a person performing an abortion in violation of its terms to criminal sanctions and to civil liability in an action brought by any person \\\\\\\"wrongfully denied notification.\\\\\\\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*427</span> Subdivision 6 authorizes a judicial bypass of the two-parent notice requirement if subdivision 2 is ever \\\\\\\"temporarily or permanently\\\\\\\" enjoined by judicial order. If the pregnant minor can convince \\\\\\\"any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction\\\\\\\" that she is \\\\\\\"mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion,\\\\\\\" or that an abortion without notice to both parents would be in her best interest, the court can authorize the physician to proceed without notice. The statute provides that the bypass procedure shall be confidential, that it shall be expedited, that the minor has a right to court-appointed counsel, and that she shall be afforded free access to the court \\\\\\\"24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\\\\\\" An order denying an abortion can be appealed on an expedited basis, but an order authorizing an abortion without notification is not subject to appeal.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*428</span> The statute contains a severability provision, but it does not include a statement of its purposes. The Minnesota Attorney General has advised us that those purposes are apparent from the statutory text and that they \\\\\\\"include the recognition and fostering of parent-child relationships, promoting counsel to a child in a difficult and traumatic choice, and providing for notice to those who are naturally most concerned for the child's welfare.\\\\\\\"<sup>[10]</sup> The District Court found that the primary purpose of the legislation was to protect the wellbeing of minors by encouraging them to discuss with their parents the decision whether to terminate their pregnancies.<sup>[11]</sup> It also found that the legislature was motivated by a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*429</span> desire to deter and dissuade minors from choosing to terminate their pregnancies.<sup>[12]</sup> The Attorney General, however, disclaims any reliance on this purpose.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>This litigation was commenced on July 30, 1981, two days before the effective date of the parental notification statute. The plaintiffs include two Minnesota doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, four clinics providing abortion and contraceptive services in metropolitan areas in Minnesota, six pregnant minors representing a class of pregnant minors, and the mother of a pregnant minor. Plaintiffs alleged that the statute violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and various provisions of the Minnesota Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>Based on the allegations in their verified complaint, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order enjoining <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*430</span> the enforcement of subdivision 2 of the statute. After a hearing, the court entered a preliminary injunction which still remains in effect. App. 31. The District Court refused, however, to rule on the validity of the judicial bypass procedure in advance of trial.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In 1986, after a 5-week trial, the District Court concluded that both the two-parent notification requirement and the 48-hour waiting period were invalid. It further concluded that the definition of the term \\\\\\\"parent,\\\\\\\" which is carried over into the notification requirement, was not severable from the remainder of the statute. The court declared the entire statute unconstitutional and enjoined the defendants from enforcing it.</p>\\\\n<p>A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed. The court first held that a compulsory notification requirement is invalid if it does not provide the pregnant minor with the option of an alternative court procedure in which she can demonstrate either her maturity or that performance of an abortion without notification would be in her best interests. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-1125, p. 62a. Second, relying heavily on the findings of the District Court concerning the impact of a two-parent notice requirement on families in which the parents are divorced, separated, or unmarried, the panel also concluded that the unconstitutional notification requirement could not be saved by the judicial bypass. The court reasoned that a mature minor and her custodial parent are in a better position than a court to determine whether notifying the noncustodial parent would be in the child's best interests and that they should not be forced to submit to a \\\\\\\"Hobson's choice\\\\\\\" between an unconstitutional notice requirement and a burdensome court bypass.<sup>[15]</sup> The panel further <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*431</span> held that the two-parent notice requirement was not severable.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The panel opinion was vacated, and the Court of Appeals reheard the case en banc. 853 F. 2d 1452 (CA8 1988). The court unanimously and summarily rejected the State's submission that the two-parent notice requirement was constitutional without any bypass procedure. <i>Id.,</i> at 1456-1457. The majority concluded, however, that subdivision 6 of the statute was valid. It agreed with the District Court that the development of a full factual record may demonstrate that a facially valid statute is \\\\\\\"unconstitutional in operation,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 1459, and that \\\\\\\"the . . . detailed factual findings concerning the general difficulties of obtaining an abortion in Minnesota and the trauma of the bypass procedure, compared to its effectiveness, raise considerable questions about the practical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*432</span> wisdom of this statute.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> In the majority's opinion, however, those questions were for the legislature to consider because the statute served valid state interests: the interest in \\\\\\\"`encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child,'\\\\\\\"<sup>[17]</sup> as well as the independent interest of the parents in the upbringing of their children.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>After noting that the State did not challenge the District Court's findings, <i>id.,</i> at 1462, the court concluded that these findings placed undue emphasis on one-parent and no-parent households. For even though the two-parent notice requirement may not further the interests of the pregnant minor in such cases, the rights of \\\\\\\"best-interest\\\\\\\" and mature minors were nevertheless protected by the bypass procedure. More importantly, \\\\\\\"as applied to all pregnant minors, regardless of their family circumstances, the district court did not consider whether parental and family interests (as distinguished from the interests of the minor alone) justified the two-parent notice requirement.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1463. The court wrote:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The district court enjoined the entire statute because of the impact of the two-parent notice requirement primarily upon one group of pregnant minors, without considering the effect of the bypass, or the parental and family interests which have been recognized by the Supreme Court. In concentrating upon the impact of the statute on the pregnant minor not living with both parents, and on the mature or non best-interest pregnant <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*433</span> minor, the district court gave only limited consideration to the 50% or more pregnant minors who live with both parents and to pregnant minors who are immature and whose best interests may require parental involvement. The district court's determination that an undue burden on the one group renders the statute unconstitutional for all is contrary to the Supreme Court's decision that a notice-consent/bypass procedure plainly serves important state interests and is narrowly drawn to protect only those interests. . . . Considering the statute as a whole and as applied to all pregnant minors, the two-parent notice requirement does not unconstitutionally burden the minor's abortion right.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1464-1465 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals also rejected the argument that the 48-hour waiting period imposed a significant burden on the minor's abortion right, finding that the waiting period could run concurrently with the scheduling of an appointment for the procedure. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the District Court without reaching the question of severability.<sup>[19]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In dissent, two members of the court criticized the majority for ignoring \\\\\\\"the evidence amassed in a five-week trial,\\\\\\\" for relying on the judicial bypass procedure \\\\\\\"to uphold an unconstitutional two-parent notification requirement,\\\\\\\" and for creating \\\\\\\"a new right, apparently of constitutional dimension, for non-custodial parents to receive notice of their minor children's activities.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1466. One of the dissenters joined a third dissenter in expressing the opinion that \\\\\\\"a single-parent notification requirement would withstand constitutional challenge.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1472. We granted certiorari, 492 U. S. 917 (1989).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*434</span> III</h2>\\\\n<p>There is a natural difference between men and women: Only women have the capacity to bear children. A woman's decision to conceive or to bear a child is a component of her liberty that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. See <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 316-318 (1980); <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678, 685, 687 (1977); <i>Cleveland Bd. of Education</i> v. <i>LaFleur,</i> 414 U. S. 632, 639-640 (1974); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 152-153 (1973); <i>id.,</i> at 168-170 (Stewart, J., concurring); <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972); <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, 502-503 (1965) (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). That Clause, as interpreted in those cases, protects the woman's right to make such decisions independently and privately, see <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 598-600, and n. 23 (1977), free of unwarranted governmental intrusion.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Moreover, the potentially severe detriment facing a pregnant woman, see <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 153, is not mitigated by her minority. Indeed, considering her probable education, employment skills, financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor. In addition, the fact of having a child brings with it adult legal responsibility, for parenthood, like attainment of the age of majority, is one of the traditional criteria for the termination of the legal disabilities of minority. In sum, there are few situations in which denying a minor the right to make an important decision will have consequences so grave and indelible.\\\\\\\" <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622, 642 (1979) <i>(Bellotti II)</i> (opinion of Powell, J.).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>As we stated in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976), the right to make this decision \\\\\\\"do[es] not mature and come into being magically only when <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*435</span> one attains the state-defined age of majority.\\\\\\\" Thus, the constitutional protection against unjustified state intrusion into the process of deciding whether or not to bear a child extends to pregnant minors as well as adult women.</p>\\\\n<p>In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of travel and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 394 U. S. 618, 631 (1969), or deny prisoners the right to marry, <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987). But the regulation of constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or she shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other than disagreement with the choice the individual has made. Cf. <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967). In the abortion area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use its own facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977); cf. <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 508-511 (1989); <i>id.,</i> at 523-524 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A State's value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support for decisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply substituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has a right to make for herself. Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause would be a nullity. A state policy favoring childbirth over abortion is not in itself a sufficient justification for overriding the woman's decision or for placing \\\\\\\"obstacles \\u00c2\\u2014 absolute or otherwise\\u00c2\\u2014in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Maher,</i> 432 U. S., at 474; see also <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S., at 315-316.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*436</span> In these cases the State of Minnesota does not rest its defense of this statute on any such value judgment. Indeed, it affirmatively disavows that state interest as a basis for upholding this law.<sup>[20]</sup> Moreover, it is clear that the state judges who have interpreted the statute in over 3,000 decisions implementing its bypass procedures have found no legislative intent to disfavor the decision to terminate a pregnancy. On the contrary, in all but a handful of cases they have approved such decisions.<sup>[21]</sup> Because the Minnesota statute unquestionably places obstacles in the pregnant minor's path to an abortion, the State has the burden of establishing its constitutionality. Under any analysis, the Minnesota statute cannot be sustained if the obstacles it imposes are not reasonably related to legitimate state interests. Cf. <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S., at 97; <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S., at 704 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 194-195, 199 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court has considered the constitutionality of statutes providing for parental consent or parental notification in six abortion cases decided during the last 14 years.<sup>[22]</sup> Although the Massachusetts statute reviewed in <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132 (1976) <i>(Bellotti I)</i><i>,</i> and <i>Bellotti II</i> required the consent of both parents, and the Utah statute reviewed in <i>H. L.</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*437</span> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S. 398 (1981), required notice to \\\\\\\"the parents,\\\\\\\"<sup>[23]</sup> none of the opinions in any of those cases focused on the possible significance of making the consent or the notice requirement applicable to both parents instead of just one. In contrast, the arguments in these cases, as well as the extensive findings of the District Court, are directed primarily at that distinction. It is therefore appropriate to summarize these findings before addressing the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period or the two-parent notification requirement, particularly since none of the findings has been challenged in either this Court or the Court of Appeals.</p>\\\\n<p>Approximately one out of every two marriages ends in divorce. 648 F. Supp. 756, 768 (Minn. 1986). Unrebutted evidence indicates that only 50% of minors in the State of Minnesota reside with both biological parents. <i>Ibid.;</i> App. 125-126. This conclusion is substantially corroborated by a study indicating that 9% of the minors in Minnesota live with neither parent and 33% live with only one parent. 648 F. Supp., at 768.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*438</span> The District Court found \\u00c2\\u2014 on the basis of extensive testimony at trial \\u00c2\\u2014 that the two-parent notification requirement had particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent when the parents were divorced or separated. Relations between the minor and absent parent were not reestablished as a result of the forced notification, thereby often producing disappointment in the minor \\\\\\\"when an anticipated reestablishment of her relationship with the absent parent d[id] not occur.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 769. Moreover, \\\\\\\"[t]he reaction of the custodial parent to the requirement of forced notification is often one of anger, resentment and frustration at the intrusion of the absent parent,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.,</i> and fear that notification will threaten the custody rights of the parent or otherwise promote intrafamily violence. Tragically, those fears were often realized:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Involuntary involvement of the second biological parent is especially detrimental when the minor comes from an abusive, dysfunctional family. Notification of the minor's pregnancy and abortion decision can provoke violence, even where the parents are divorced or separated. Studies have shown that violence and harassment may continue well beyond the divorce, especially when children are involved.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\". . . Furthermore, a mother's perception in a dysfunctional family that there will be violence if the father learns of the daughter's pregnancy is likely to be an accurate perception.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court further found:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Twenty to twenty-five percent of the minors who go to court either are accompanied by one parent who knows and consents to the abortion or have already told one parent of their intent to terminate their pregnancy. The vast majority of these voluntarily informed parents <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*439</span> are women who are divorced or separated from spouses whom they have not seen in years. Going to court to avoid notifying the other parent burdens the privacy of both the minor and the accompanying parent. The custodial parents are angry that their consent is not sufficient and fear that notification will bring the absent parent back into the family in an intrusive and abusive way.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court also found that the two-parent notification requirement had adverse effects in families in which the minor lives with both parents. These effects were particularly pronounced in the distressingly large number of cases in which family violence is a serious problem. The court found that many minors in Minnesota \\\\\\\"live in fear of violence by family members\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"are, in fact, victims of rape, incest, neglect and violence.\\\\\\\"<sup>[25]</sup> The District Court found that few minors can take advantage of the exception for a minor who declares that she is a victim of sexual or physical abuse because of the obligation to report the information to the authorities and the attendant loss of privacy. See Findings 46 and 47, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*440</span> 648 F. Supp., at 764.<sup>[26]</sup> This concern about family violence helps to explain why the District Court found that in many instances the requirement that both parents be notified actually impairs family communication. Minors who otherwise would inform one parent were unwilling to do so when such notification likely would also involve the parent in the torturous ordeal of explaining to a court why the second parent should not be notified. The court found:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Minors who ordinarily would notify one parent may be dissuaded from doing so by the two-parent requirement. A minor who must go to court for authorization in any event may elect not to tell either parent. In these instances, the requirement that minors notify both biological parents actually reduces parent-child communication.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 769.<sup>[27]</sup></blockquote>\\\\n<p>The great majority of bypass petitions are filed in the three metropolitan counties in Minnesota, where courts schedule bypass hearings on a regular basis and have in place procedures for hearing emergency petitions. <i>Id.,</i> at 762. Courts in the nonmetropolitan areas are acquainted with the statute and, for the most part, apply it conscientiously, but a number of counties are served by judges who are unwilling to hear bypass petitions. <i>Id.,</i> at 763. Aside from the unavoidable <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*441</span> notification of court officials, the confidentiality of minors has been maintained. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>During the period between August 1, 1981, and March 1, 1986, 3,573 judicial bypass petitions were filed in Minnesota courts. All but 15 were granted.<sup>[28]</sup> The judges who adjudicated over 90% of these petitions testified; none of them identified any positive effects of the law.<sup>[29]</sup> The court experience produced fear, tension, anxiety, and shame among minors, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*442</span> causing some who were mature, and some whose best interests would have been served by an abortion, to \\\\\\\"forego the bypass option and either notify their parents or carry to term.\\\\\\\" Finding 44, 648 F. Supp., at 763. Among parents who supported their daughters in the bypass proceedings, the court experience evoked similar reactions.<sup>[30]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Scheduling petitions in the Minnesota court typically required minors to wait only two or three days for hearings. The District Court found, however, that the statutory waiting period of 48 hours was frequently compounded by a number of other factors that \\\\\\\"commonly\\\\\\\" created a delay of 72 hours, <i>id.,</i> at 764-765, and, \\\\\\\"in many cases\\\\\\\" a delay of a week or more in effecting a decision to terminate a pregnancy. <i>Id.,</i> at 765. A delay of that magnitude increased the medical risk associated with the abortion procedure to \\\\\\\"a statistically significant degree.\\\\\\\" Finding 43, 648 F. Supp., at 763. While recognizing that a mandatory delay following the notice to a minor's parent served the State's interest in protecting pregnant minors, the court found that that interest could be served by a shorter waiting period. <i>Id.,</i> at 779-780.</p>\\\\n<p>At least 37 witnesses testified to the issue whether the statute furthered the State's interest in protecting pregnant minors. Only two witnesses testified that a two-parent notification statute did minors more good than harm; neither of these witnesses had direct experience with the Minnesota statute. Summarizing its findings on the question whether the statute as a whole furthered the State's interests, the District Court wrote:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Of the remaining witnesses who spoke to the issue whether Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343 effectuates the State's interest in protecting pregnant minors, all but four of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*443</span> these are personally involved in the statute's implementation in Minnesota. They are judges, public defenders, guardians ad litem, and clinic counselors. None of these witnesses testified that the statute has a beneficial effect upon the minors whom it affects. Some testified the law has a negligible [e]ffect upon intra-family communication and upon the minors' decision-making process. Others testified the statute has a deleterious effect on the wellbeing of the minors to whom it applies because it increases the stress attendant to the abortion decision without creating any corresponding benefit. Thus five weeks of trial have produced no factual basis upon which this court can find that Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(2)-(7) on the whole furthers in any meaningful way the state's interest in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 775.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Focusing specifically on the statutory requirement that both parents be notified, the District Court concluded:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The court finds that this requirement places a significant burden upon pregnant minors who do not live with both parents. Particularly in these cases, notification of an abusive, or even a disinterested, absent parent has the effect of reintroducing that parent's disruptive or unhelpful participation into the family at a time of acute stress. Similarly, the two-parent notification requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of minors in two parent homes who voluntarily have consulted with one parent but not with the other out of fear of psychological, sexual, or physical abuse toward either the minor or the notified parent. In either case, the alternative of going to court to seek authorization to proceed without notifying the second parent introduces a traumatic distraction into her relationship with the parent whom the minor has notified. The anxiety attending either option tends to interfere with and burden the parent-child communication <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*444</span> the minor voluntarily initiated with the custodial parent.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\". . . Indeed, 20 to 25% of minors seeking judicial authorization to proceed with an abortion without parental notification are accompanied to court by one parent, or at least have obtained the approval of one parent. In these cases the necessity either to notify the second parent despite the agreement of both the minor and the notified parent that such notification is undesirable, or to obtain a judicial waiver of the notification requirement, distracts the minor and her parent and disrupts their communication. Thus the need to notify the second parent or to make a burdensome court appearance actively interferes with the parent-child communication voluntarily initiated by the child, communication assertedly at the heart of the State's purpose in requiring notification of both parents. In these cases, requiring notification of both parents affirmatively discourages parent-child communication.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 777-778.</blockquote>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>V</h2>\\\\n<p>Three separate but related interests \\u00c2\\u2014 the interest in the welfare of the pregnant minor, the interest of the parents, and the interest of the family unit \\u00c2\\u2014 are relevant to our consideration of the constitutionality of the 48-hour waiting period and the two-parent notification requirement.</p>\\\\n<p>The State has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.

Although the Court has held that parents may not exercise \\\\\\\"an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto\\\\\\\" over that decision, <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U.

As JUSTICE WHITE explained in his opinion for the Court in <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U.

The rights to conceive and to raise one's children have been deemed `essential,' <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923), `basic civil rights of man,' <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 316 U.

We have held that when a parent or another person has assumed \\\\\\\"primary responsibility\\\\\\\" for a minor's well-being, the State may properly enact \\\\\\\"laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility.\\\\\\\" <i>Ginsberg</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 390 U. S. 629, 639 (1968). To the extent that subdivision 2 of the Minnesota statute requires notification of only one parent, it does just that. The brief waiting period provides the parent the opportunity to consult with his or her spouse and a family physician, and it permits the parent to inquire into the competency of the doctor performing the abortion, discuss the religious or moral implications of the abortion decision, and provide the daughter needed guidance and counsel in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*449</span> evaluating the impact of the decision on her future. See <i>Zbaraz</i> v. <i>Hartigan,</i> 763 F. 2d 1532, 1552 (CA7 1985) (Coffey, J., dissenting), aff'd by an equally divided Court, 484 U. S. 171 (1987).</p>\\\\n<p>The 48-hour delay imposes only a minimal burden on the right of the minor to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Although the District Court found that scheduling factors, weather, and the minor's school and work commitments may combine, in many cases, to create a delay of a week or longer between the initiation of notification and the abortion, 648 F. Supp., at 765, there is no evidence that the 48-hour period itself is unreasonable or longer than appropriate for adequate consultation between parent and child. The statute does not impose any period of delay once a court, acting <i>in loco parentis,</i> or the parents express their agreement that the minor is mature or that the procedure would be in her best interest. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals noted and the record reveals,<sup>[34]</sup> the 48-hour waiting period may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the procedure, thus resulting in little or no delay.<sup>[35]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*450</span> VII</h2>\\\\n<p>It is equally clear that the requirement that <i>both</i> parents be notified, whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed responsibility for the upbringing of the child, does not reasonably further any legitimate state interest. The usual justification for a parental consent or notification provision is that it supports the authority of a parent who is presumed to act in the minor's best interest and thereby assures that the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy is knowing, intelligent, and deliberate. To the extent that such an interest is legitimate, it would be fully served by a requirement that the minor notify one parent who can then seek the counsel of his or her mate or any other party, when such advice and support is deemed necessary to help the child make a difficult decision. In the ideal family setting, of course, notice to either parent would normally constitute notice to both. A statute requiring two-parent notification would not further any state interest in those instances. In many families, however, the parent notified by the child would not notify the other parent. In those cases the State has no legitimate interest in questioning one parent's judgment that notice to the other parent would not assist the minor or in presuming that the parent who has assumed parental duties is incompetent to make decisions regarding the health and welfare of the child.</p>\\\\n<p>Not only does two-parent notification fail to serve any state interest with respect to functioning families, it disserves the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with respect to dysfunctional families. The record reveals that in the thousands of dysfunctional families affected by this statute, the two-parent notice requirement proved positively harmful to the minor and her family. The testimony <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*451</span> at trial established that this requirement, ostensibly designed for the benefit of the minor, resulted in major trauma to the child, and often to a parent as well. In some cases, the parents were divorced and the second parent did not have custody or otherwise participate in the child's upbringing. App. 244-245; <i>id.,</i> at 466; <i>id.,</i> at 115. In these circumstances, the privacy of the parent and child was violated, even when they suffered no other physical or psychological harm. In other instances, however, the second parent had either deserted or abused the child, <i>id.,</i> at 462, 464, had died under tragic circumstances, <i>id.,</i> at 120-121, or was not notified because of the considered judgment that notification would inflict unnecessary stress on a parent who was ill. <i>Id.,</i> at 204, 465.<sup>[36]</sup> In these circumstances, the statute was not merely ineffectual in achieving the State's goals but actually counterproductive. The focus on notifying the second parent distracted both the parent and minor from the minor's imminent abortion decision.</p>\\\\n<p>The State does not rely primarily on the best interests of the minor in defending this statute. Rather, it argues that, in the ideal family, the minor should make her decision only <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*452</span> after consultation with both parents who should naturally be concerned with the child's welfare and that the State has an interest in protecting the independent right of the parents \\\\\\\"to determine and strive for what they believe to be best for their children.\\\\\\\" Minn. Br. 26. Neither of these reasons can justify the two-parent notification requirement. The second parent may well have an interest in the minor's abortion decision, making full communication among all members of a family desirable in some cases, but such communication may not be decreed by the State. The State has no more interest in requiring all family members to talk with one another than it has in requiring certain of them to live together. In <i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland,</i> 431 U. S. 494 (1977), we invalidated a zoning ordinance which \\\\\\\"slic[ed] deeply into the family itself,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 498, permitting the city to \\\\\\\"standardiz[e] its children\\u00c2\\u2014 and its adults \\u00c2\\u2014 by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 506. Although the ordinance was supported by state interests other than the State's interest in substituting its conception of family life for the family's own view, the ordinance's relation to those state interests was too \\\\\\\"tenuous\\\\\\\" to satisfy constitutional standards. By implication, a state interest in standardizing its children and adults, making the \\\\\\\"private realm of family life\\\\\\\" conform to some state-designed ideal, is not a legitimate state interest at all. See also <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S., at 399-400 (right to establish a home and bring up children may not be interfered with by legislative action which is without \\\\\\\"reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State to effect\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Nor can any state interest in protecting a parent's interest in shaping a child's values and lifestyle overcome the liberty interests of a minor acting with the consent of a single parent or court. See <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (1979); <i>Bellotti I,</i> 428 U. S. 132 (1976); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976). In <i>Danforth,</i> the majority identified the only state interest in requiring parental consent <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*453</span> as that in \\\\\\\"the safeguarding of the family unit and of parental authority\\\\\\\" and held that that state interest was insufficient to support the requirement that mature minors receive parental consent. The Court summarily concluded that \\\\\\\"[a]ny independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter's pregnancy is no more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 75. It follows that the combined force of the separate interest of one parent and the minor's privacy interest must outweigh the separate interest of the second parent.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Bellotti I</i> and <i>Bellotti II,</i> we also identified the difference between parental interests and the child's best interest. Although the District Court invalidated the Massachusetts statute there under review on the grounds that it permitted a parent or the court, acting <i>in loco parentis,</i> to refuse consent based on the parent's own interests, the state attorney general argued that the parental right consisted \\\\\\\"`exclusively of the right to assess independently, for their minor child, what will serve that child's best interest.'\\\\\\\" 428 U. S., at 144. Because we believed that the attorney general's interpretation \\\\\\\"would avoid or substantially modify the federal constitutional challenge,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 148, we ordered the District Court to certify the state-law question to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. <i>Id.,</i> at 151-152. On review in this Court for the second time, after the Supreme Judicial Court stated unambiguously that the \\\\\\\"good cause\\\\\\\" standard required the judge to grant consent to an abortion found to be in the minor's best interest, 443 U. S., at 630, 644 (opinion of Powell, J.), we confirmed that such a construction satisfied \\\\\\\"some of the concerns\\\\\\\" about the statute's constitutionality, <i>id.,</i> at 644, and thereby avoided \\\\\\\"much of what was objectionable in the statute successfully challenged in <i>Danforth,\\\\\\\" id.,</i> at 645. Indeed, the constitutional defects that Justice Powell identified in the statute\\u00c2\\u2014its failure to allow a minor who is found to be mature and fully competent to make the abortion <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*454</span> decision independently and its requirement of parental consultation even when an abortion without notification would be in the minor's best interests \\u00c2\\u2014 are predicated on the assumption that the justification for any rule requiring parental involvement in the abortion decision rests entirely on the best interests of the child. <i>Id.,</i> at 651.<sup>[37]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the Minnesota two-parent notification requirement is an oddity among state and federal consent provisions governing the health, welfare, and education of children. A minor desiring to enlist in the armed services or the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) need only obtain the consent of \\\\\\\"his parent or guardian.\\\\\\\" 10 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 505(a), 2104(b)(4), 2107(b)(4). The consent of \\\\\\\"a parent or guardian\\\\\\\" is also sufficient to obtain a passport for foreign travel from the United States Department of State, 22 CFR \\u00c2\\u00a7 51.27 (1989) (emphasis added), and to participate as a subject in most forms of medical research, 45 CFR \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a746.404, 46.405 (1988). In virtually every State, the consent of one parent is enough to obtain a driver's license or operator's permit. The same may be said with respect to the decision to submit to any medical or surgical procedure other than an abortion.<sup>[38]</sup> Indeed, the only other Minnesota statute that the State has identified which requires two-parent consent <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*455</span> is that authorizing the minor to change his name. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 32; Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 88-1309, p. 5 (citing Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 259.10 (1988)). These statutes provide testimony to the unreasonableness of the Minnesota two-parent notification requirement and to the ease with which the State can adopt less burdensome means to protect the minor's welfare. Cf. <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Jeter,</i> 486 U. S. 456, 464 (1988); <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S., at 98. We therefore hold that this requirement violates the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>VIII</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court holds that the constitutional objection to the two-parent notice requirement is removed by the judicial bypass option provided in subdivision 6 of the Minnesota statute. I respectfully dissent from that holding.</p>\\\\n<p>A majority of the Court has previously held that a statute requiring one parent's consent to a minor's abortion will be upheld if the State provides an \\\\\\\"`alternative procedure whereby a pregnant minor may demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests.'\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476, 491 (1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 505 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). Indeed, in <i>Bellotti II,</i> four Members of the Court expressed the same opinion about a statute requiring the consent of both parents. See 443 U. S., at 643-644 (opinion of Powell, J.). Neither of those precedents should control our decision today.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Bellotti II,</i> eight Members of the Court joined the judgment holding the Massachusetts statute unconstitutional. Thus, the Court did not <i>hold</i> that the judicial bypass set forth in that statute was valid; it held just the opposite. Moreover, the discussion of the minimum requirements for a valid judicial bypass in Justice Powell's opinion was joined by only three other Members of the Court. Indeed, neither the arguments of the parties, nor any of the opinions in the case, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*456</span> considered the significant difference between a statute requiring the involvement of <i>both</i> parents in the abortion decision and a statute that merely requires the involvement of one. Thus, the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> does not require that the standards articulated in Justice Powell's opinion be applied to a statute that mandates the involvement of both parents.</p>\\\\n<p>Unlike <i>Bellotti II,</i> the judgment in <i>Ashcroft</i> sustained the constitutionality of the statute containing a judicial bypass as an alternative to the requirement of <i>one</i> parent's consent to a minor's abortion. The distinctions between notice and consent and between notification of both parents rather than just one arguably constitute a sufficient response to an argument resting on <i>stare decisis.</i> Further analysis is necessary, however, because, at least on the surface, the consent requirement would appear to be more onerous than a requirement of mere notice.</p>\\\\n<p>The significance of the distinction between a statute requiring the consent of one parent and a statute requiring notice to both parents must be tested by the relationship of the respective requirements to legitimate state interests. We have concluded that the State has a strong and legitimate interest in providing a pregnant minor with the advice and support of a parent during the decisional period. A general rule requiring the minor to obtain the consent of one parent reasonably furthers that interest. An exception from the general rule is necessary to protect the minor from an arbitrary veto that is motivated by the separate concerns of the parent rather than the best interest of the child. Cf. <i>Parham</i> v. <i>J. R.,</i> 442 U. S., at 604-608. But the need for an exception does not undermine the conclusion that the general rule is perfectly reasonable \\u00c2\\u2014 just as a rule requiring the consent of either parent for any other medical procedure would surely be reasonable if an exception were made for those emergencies in which, for example, a parent might deny lifesaving <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*457</span> treatment to a child on religious grounds. See <i>id.,</i> at 602-603.</p>\\\\n<p>For reasons already set forth at length, a rule requiring consent or notification of both parents is not reasonably related to the state interest in giving the pregnant minor the benefit of parental advice. The State has not called our attention to, nor am I aware of, any other medical situation in Minnesota or elsewhere in which the provision of treatment for a child has been conditioned on notice to, or consent by, both parents rather than just one. Indeed, the fact that one-parent consent is the virtually uniform rule for any other activity which affects the minor's health, safety, or welfare emphasizes the aberrant quality of the two-parent notice requirement.</p>\\\\n<p>A judicial bypass that is designed to handle exceptions from a reasonable general rule, and thereby preserve the constitutionality of that rule, is quite different from a requirement that a minor\\u00c2\\u2014or a minor and one of her parents \\u00c2\\u2014 must apply to a court for permission to avoid the application of a rule that is not reasonably related to legitimate state goals. A requirement that a minor acting with the consent of <i>both</i> parents apply to a court for permission to effectuate her decision clearly would constitute an unjustified official interference with the privacy of the minor and her family. The requirement that the bypass procedure must be invoked when the minor and one parent agree that the other parent should not be notified represents an equally unjustified governmental intrusion into the family's decisional process. When the parents are living together and have joint custody over the child, the State has no legitimate interest in the communication between father and mother about the child. \\\\\\\"[W]here the parents are divorced, the minor and/or custodial parent, and not a court, is in the best position to determine whether notifying the non-custodial parent would be in the child's best interests.\\\\\\\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-1125, p. 69a. As the Court of Appeals panel originally <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*458</span> concluded, the \\\\\\\"minor and custodial parent, . . . by virtue of their major interest and superior position, should alone have the opportunity to decide to whom, if anyone, notice of the minor's abortion decision should be given.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citation omitted). I agree with that conclusion.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety is affirmed.</p>\\\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in part.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>I join all but Parts III and VIII of JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion. While I agree with some of the central points made in Part III, I cannot join the broader discussion. I agree that the Court has characterized \\\\\\\"[a] woman's decision to conceive or to bear a child [as] a component of her liberty that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 434.

It is with that understanding that I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS' statement that the \\\\\\\"statute cannot be sustained if the obstacles it imposes are not reasonably related to legitimate state interests. Cf. <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S., at 97; <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S., at 704 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 194-195, 199 (1973).\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 436.</p>\\\\n<p>I agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that Minnesota has offered no sufficient justification for its interference with the family's decisionmaking processes created by subdivision 2 of Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343 (1988)\\u00c2\\u2014 two-parent notification. Subdivision 2 is the most stringent notification statute in the country. See <i>ante,</i> at 425, n. 5. The only other State that defines the generic term \\\\\\\"parents,\\\\\\\" see, <i>e. g.,</i> Tenn. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 36-1-201, Art. III (6) (Supp. 1989) (adoption statute) (\\\\\\\"`Parents' <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*460</span> means either the singular or plural of the word `parent'\\\\\\\"); see also <i>ante,</i> at 437, n. 23, as \\\\\\\"both parents\\\\\\\" is Arkansas, and that statute provides for numerous exceptions to the two-parent notification requirement and permits bypassing notification where notification would not be in the best interests of the minor. See Ark. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 20-16-802, 20-16-804, 20-16-808 (Supp. 1989).</p>\\\\n<p>The Minnesota exception to notification for minors who are victims of neglect or abuse is, in reality, a means of notifying the parents. As JUSTICE STEVENS points out, see <i>ante,</i> at 426, n. 7, to avail herself of the neglect or abuse exception, the minor must report the abuse. A report requires the welfare agency to immediately \\\\\\\"conduct an assessment.\\\\\\\" Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556(10)(a) (1988). If the agency interviews the victim, it must notify the parent of the fact of the interview; if the parent is the subject of an investigation, he has a right of access to the record of the investigation. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556 (10)(c); 626.556(11); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19 (\\\\\\\"[I]t turns out that the reporting statute in Minnesota requires that after it's reported to the welfare department, the welfare department has to do an assessment and tell the parents about the assessment. This could all be done in a time frame even before the abortion occurs\\\\\\\"). The combination of the abused minor's reluctance to report sexual or physical abuse, see <i>ante,</i> at 440, n. 26, with the likelihood that invoking the abuse exception for the purpose of avoiding notice will result in notice, makes the abuse exception less than effectual.</p>\\\\n<p>Minnesota's two-parent notice requirement is all the more unreasonable when one considers that only half of the minors in the State of Minnesota reside with both biological parents. See <i>ante,</i> at 437. A third live with only one parent. <i>Ibid.</i> Given its broad sweep and its failure to serve the purposes asserted by the State in too many cases, I join the Court's striking of subdivision 2.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*461</span> II</h2>\\\\n<p>In a series of cases, this Court has explicitly approved judicial bypass as a means of tailoring a parental consent provision so as to avoid unduly burdening the minor's limited right to obtain an abortion. See <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132, 147-148 (1976); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976); <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 642-644 (opinion of Powell, J.). In <i>Danforth,</i> the Court stated that the</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"primary constitutional deficiency lies in [the notification statute's] imposition of an absolute limitation on the minor's right to obtain an abortion. . . . [A] materially different constitutional issue would be presented under a provision requiring parental consent or consultation in most cases but providing for prompt (i) judicial resolution of any disagreement between the parent and the minor, or (ii) judicial determination that the minor is mature enough to give an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion in any event is in the minor's best interest. Such a provision would not impose parental approval as an absolute condition upon the minor's right but would assure in most instances consultation between the parent and child.\\\\\\\" 428 U. S., at 90-91.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Subdivision 6 passes constitutional muster because the interference with the internal operation of the family required by subdivision 2 simply does not exist where the minor can avoid notifying one or both parents by use of the bypass procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>I concur in Parts I, II, IV, and VII of JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion for the Court in No. 88-1309.<sup>[1]</sup> Although I do <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*462</span> not believe that the Constitution permits a State to require a minor to notify or consult with a parent before obtaining an abortion, compare <i>ante,</i> at 445, with <i>infra,</i> at 463-472, I am in substantial agreement with the remainder of the reasoning in Part V of JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion. For the reasons stated by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 450-455, Minnesota's two-parent notification requirement is not even reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. Therefore, that requirement surely would not pass the strict scrutiny applicable to restrictions on a woman's fundamental right to have an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>I dissent from the judgment of the Court in No. 88-1125, however, that the judicial bypass option renders the parental notification and 48-hour delay requirements constitutional. See <i>ante,</i> at 461 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 497-501 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). The bypass procedure cannot save those requirements because the bypass itself is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied. At the very least, this scheme substantially burdens a woman's right to privacy without advancing a compelling state interest. More significantly, in some instances it usurps a young woman's control over her own body by giving either a parent or a court the power effectively to veto her decision to have an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>This Court has consistently held since <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that the constitutional right of privacy \\\\\\\"is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 153. We have also repeatedly stated that \\\\\\\"[a] woman's right to make that choice freely is fundamental.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 772 (1986). Accord, <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 420, n. 1 (1983); <i>Roe, supra,</i> at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*463</span> 155. As we reiterated in <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra,</i> \\\\\\\"Few decisions are more personal and intimate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy, than a woman's decision \\u00c2\\u2014 with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in <i>Roe</i>\\u00c2\\u2014whether to end her preguancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 772. Accordingly, we have subjected state laws limiting that right to the most exacting scrutiny, requiring a State to show that such a law is narrowly drawn to serve a compelling interest. <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 155; <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra,</i> at 427. Only such strict judicial scrutiny is sufficiently protective of a woman's right to make the intensely personal decision whether to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> remains the law of the land. See <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 521 (1989) (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 525 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 537, 560 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, today's decision reaffirms the vitality of <i>Roe,</i> as five Justices have voted to strike down a state law restricting a woman's right to have an abortion. Accordingly, to be constitutional, state restrictions on abortion must meet the rigorous test set forth above.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>I strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion that the State may constitutionally force a minor woman either to notify both parents (or in some cases only one parent<sup>[2]</sup>) and then wait 48 hours before proceeding with an abortion, or disclose her intimate affairs to a judge and ask that he grant her permission to have an abortion. See <i>post,</i> at 497-501 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 448-449 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (finding that requiring minor to wait 48 hours after notifying <i>one</i> parent reasonably furthers legitimate state interest). <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*464</span> First, the parental notification and delay requirements significantly restrict a young woman's right to reproductive choice. I base my conclusion not on my intuition about the needs and attitudes of young women, but on a sizable and impressive collection of empirical data documenting the effects of parental notification statutes and of delaying an abortion. Second, the burdensome restrictions are not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling state interest. Finally, for the reasons discussed in Part III, <i>infra,</i> the judicial bypass procedure does not save the notice and delay requirements.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Neither the scope of a woman's privacy right nor the magnitude of a law's burden is diminished because a woman is a minor. <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622, 642 (1979) <i>(Bellotti II)</i> (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976). Rather, a woman's minority status affects only the nature of the State's interests. Although the Court considers the burdens that the two-parent notification requirement imposes on a minor woman's exercise of her right to privacy, <i>ante,</i> at 450-451, and n. 36, it fails to recognize that forced notification of only one parent also significantly burdens a young woman's right to have an abortion, see <i>ante,</i> at 459-460 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.); <i>post,</i> at 491-497 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 448-449 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).</p>\\\\n<p>A substantial proportion of pregnant minors voluntarily consult with a parent regardless of the existence of a notification requirement. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Torres, Forrest, &amp; Eisman, Telling Parents: Clinic Policies and Adolescents' Use of Family Planning and Abortion Services, 12 Family Planning Perspectives 284, 287, 288, 290 (1980) (51% of minors discussed abortion with parents in the absence of a parental consent or notification requirement). Minors 15 years old or younger are even more likely voluntarily to discuss the abortion decision with their parents. <i>Id.,</i> at 290 (69% of such minors voluntarily <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*465</span> discuss abortion with parents). For these women, the notification requirement by itself does not impose a significant burden. But for those young women who would choose not to inform their parents, the burden is evident: The notification requirement destroys their right to avoid disclosure of a deeply personal matter. Cf. <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 599-600 (1977).</p>\\\\n<p>A notification requirement can also have severe physical and psychological effects on a young woman. First, forced notification of one parent, like forced notification of both parents, can be extremely traumatic for a young woman, depending on the nature of her relationship with her parents. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 450-451, and n. 36. The disclosure of a daughter's intention to have an abortion often leads to a family crisis, characterized by severe parental anger and rejection. Osofsky &amp; Osofsky, Teenage Pregnancy: Psychosocial Considerations, 21 Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology 1161, 1164-1165 (1978). The impact of any notification requirement is especially devastating for minors who live in fear of physical, psychological, or sexual abuse. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Clary, Minor Women Obtaining Abortions: A Study of Parental Notification in a Metropolitan Area, 72 American J. of Pub. Health 283, 284 (1982) (finding that many minors chose not to inform parents voluntarily because of fear of negative consequences such as physical punishment or other retaliation). See also Tr. 911 (testimony of Dr. Elissa Benedek) (stating that usually minors accurately predict parental reaction to news about daughters' pregnancies). Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 438-440, and n. 25. Certainly, child abuse is not limited to families with two parents.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, the prospect of having to notify a parent causes many young women to delay their abortions, thereby increasing the health risks of the procedure. See Cates, Schulz, &amp; Grimes, The Risks Associated with Teenage Abortion, 309 New England J. of Medicine 621, 623 (1983) (finding that for women 19 years old and younger, the number of deaths per 100,000 abortions was 0.2 for the first 8 weeks of pregnancy, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*466</span> 0.6 for weeks 9 through 12, 3.4 for weeks 13 through 16, and 7.8 for week 17 and after). See also <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S. 398, 439 (1981) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). The risks posed by this delay are especially significant because adolescents already delay seeking medical care until relatively late in their pregnancies, when risks are higher. See 1 National Research Council, Risking the Future: Adolescent Sexuality, Pregnancy, and Childbearing 114 (C. Hayes ed. 1987).</p>\\\\n<p>In addition, a notification requirement compels many minors seeking an abortion to travel to a State without such a requirement to avoid notifying a parent. Cartoof &amp; Klerman, Parental Consent for Abortion: Impact of the Massachusetts Law, 76 American J. of Pub. Health 397, 399 (1986) (finding that one-third of minors seeking abortions traveled outside of State to avoid Massachusetts' parental notice requirement). Other women may resort to the horrors of self-abortion or illegal abortion rather than tell a parent. Torres, Forrest, &amp; Eisman, <i>supra,</i> at 288 (9% of minors attending family planning clinics said they would have a selfinduced or illegal abortion rather then tell a parent); <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson, supra,</i> at 439, and n. 26 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). See also Greydanus &amp; Railsback, Abortion in Adolescence, 1 Seminars in Adolescent Medicine 213, 214 (1985) (noting 100-times greater death rate for women who obtain illegal abortions than for those who obtain legal ones).<sup>[3]</sup> Still others would forgo an abortion entirely and carry the fetus to term, Torres, Forrest, &amp; Eisman, <i>supra,</i> at 289, 291 (9% of minors in family planning clinics said they would carry fetus <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*467</span> to term rather than inform parents of decision to abort), subjecting themselves to the much greater health risks of pregnancy and childbirth and to the physical, psychological, and financial hardships of unwanted motherhood. See Greydanus &amp; Railsback, <i>supra,</i> at 214 (noting that minor's overall risk of dying from childbirth is over nine times greater than risk of dying from legal abortion); Lewis, Minors' Competence to Consent to Abortion, 42 American Psychologist 84, 87 (1987) (\\\\\\\"[P]regnancy continuation poses far greater psychological, physical, and economic risks to the adolescent than does abortion\\\\\\\") (citation omitted). See also <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 642 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\\\\\\\"[C]onsidering her probable education, employment skills, financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor\\\\\\\"). Clearly, then, requiring notification of one parent significantly burdens a young woman's right to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>The 48-hour delay <i>after</i> notification further aggravates the harm caused by the pre-notification delay that may flow from a minor's fear of notifying a parent. Moreover, the 48-hour delay burdens the rights of all minors, including those who would voluntarily consult with one or both parents.<sup>[4]</sup> JUSTICE STEVENS' assertion that the 48-hour delay \\\\\\\"imposes only a minimal burden,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 449; see also <i>post,</i> at 496 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), ignores the increased health risks and costs that this delay entails. The District Court specifically found as a matter of fact that \\\\\\\"[d]elay of any length in performing an abortion increases the statistical risk of mortality and morbidity.\\\\\\\" 648 F. Supp. 756, 765 (Minn. 1986). Even a brief delay can have a particularly detrimental impact if it pushes the abortion into the second trimester, when the operation is substantially more risky and costly. <i>Ibid.</i> See <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*468</span> also C. Tietze &amp; S. Henshaw, Induced Abortion: A World Review 1986, pp. 103-104 (6th ed. 1986) (rate of major complications nearly doubles in the week following the end of the first trimester and increases significantly thereafter). Moreover, the District Court found that the 48-hour delay \\\\\\\"frequently is compounded by scheduling factors such as clinic hours, transportation requirements, weather, a minor's school and work commitments, and sometimes a single parent's family and work commitments,\\\\\\\" often resulting in an effective delay of a week or more. 648 F. Supp., at 765.<sup>[5]</sup> The increased risk caused by a delay of that magnitude, the District Court found, is statistically significant at any point in the pregnancy. <i>Ibid.</i> Certainly no pregnant woman facing these heightened risks to her health would dismiss them as \\\\\\\"minimal.\\\\\\\"<sup>[6]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*469</span> C</h2>\\\\n<p>Because the parental notification and delay requirements burden a young woman's right freely to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy, the State must show that these requirements are justified by a compelling state interest and are closely tailored to further that interest. The main purpose of the notification requirement is to \\\\\\\"protect the well-being of minors by encouraging minors to discuss with their parents the decision whether to terminate their pregnancies\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 766. The 48-hour delay, in turn, is designed to provide parents with adequate time to consult with their daughters. <i>Ante,</i> at 448-449 (opinion of STEVENS, J.); <i>post,</i> at 496 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). As JUSTICE STEVENS states, such consultation is intended to ensure that the minor's decision is \\\\\\\"knowing and intelligent.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 448. I need not determine whether the State's interest ultimately outweighs young women's privacy interests, however, because the strictures here are not closely tailored to further the State's asserted goal.</p>\\\\n<p>For the many young women who would voluntarily consult with a parent before having an abortion, see <i>supra,</i> at 464-465, the notification and delay requirements are superfluous, and so do not advance the State's interest. The requirements affect only those women who would not otherwise notify a parent. But compelled notification is unlikely to result in productive consultation in families in which a daughter does not feel comfortable consulting her parents about intimate or sexual matters. See Melton, Legal Regulation of Adolescent Abortion: Unintended Effects, 42 American Psychologist 79, 81 (1987) (stating that in many families, compelled parental notification is unlikely to result in meaningful discussion about the daughter's predicament); Tr. 1357-1358 (testimony of Dr. Steven Butzer) (stating that involuntary disclosure is disruptive to family and has \\\\\\\"almost universally negative\\\\\\\" effects, in accord with minor's expectations). <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*470</span> Moreover, in those families with a history of child abuse, a pregnant minor forced to notify a parent is more likely to be greeted by physical assault or psychological harassment than open and caring conversation about her predicament. See Tr. 316 (testimony of Dr. Lenore Walker) (stating that forced notification in dysfunctional families is likely to sever communication patterns and increase the risk of violence); <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S., at 446 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Forced notification in such situations would amount to punishing the daughter for the lack of a stable and communicative family environment, when the blame for that situation lies principally, if not entirely, with the parents. Parental notification in the less-than-ideal family, therefore, would not lead to an informed decision by the minor.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The State also claims that the statute serves the interest of protecting parents' independent right \\\\\\\"to shape the[ir] child[ren]'s values and life style[s]\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"to determine and strive for what they believe to be best for their children.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 88-1309, p. 26. If this is so, the statute is surely underinclusive, as it does not require parental notification where the minor seeks medical treatment for pregnancy, venereal disease, or alcohol and other drug abuse. See Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(1) (1988). Are we to believe that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*471</span> Minnesota parents have no interest in their children's well-being in these other contexts?</p>\\\\n<p>In any event, parents' right to direct their children's upbringing is a right <i>against</i> state interference with family matters. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944) (noting that this Court's decisions \\\\\\\"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter\\\\\\\"). See also <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder,</i> 406 U. S. 205, 232 (1972); <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510, 534-535 (1925). Yet, ironically, the State's requirements here affirmatively interfere in family life by trying to force families to conform to the State's archetype of the ideal family. Cf. <i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland,</i> 431 U. S. 494, 506 (1977) (plurality opinion) (\\\\\\\"[T]he Constitution prevents [the State] from standardizing its children \\u00c2\\u2014 and its adults \\u00c2\\u2014 by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns\\\\\\\"); <i>ante,</i> at 452. It is a strange constitutional alchemy that would transform a limitation on state power into a justification for governmental intrusion into family interactions. Moreover, as a practical matter, \\\\\\\"state intervention is hardly likely to resurrect parental authority that the parents themselves are unable to preserve.\\\\\\\" <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson, supra,</i> at 448 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). See also <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.,</i> 428 U. S., at 75 (finding it unlikely that parental veto power over abortion \\\\\\\"will enhance parental authority or control where the minor and the nonconsenting parent are so fundamentally in conflict and the very existence of the pregnancy already has fractured the family structure\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Even if the State's interest is construed as merely the <i>facilitation</i> of the exercise of parental authority, the notification and delay requirements are not narrowly drawn. Parental authority is not limitless. Certainly where parental involvement threatens to harm the child, the parent's authority must yield. <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts, supra,</i> at 169-170; <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson, supra,</i> at 449 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Yet the notification and delay requirements facilitate <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*472</span> the exercise of parental authority even where it may physically or psychologically harm the child. See <i>supra,</i> at 470.</p>\\\\n<p>Furthermore, the exercise of parental authority in some instances will take the form of obstructing the minor's decision to have an abortion. A parent who objects to the abortion, once notified, can exert strong pressure on the minor \\u00c2\\u2014 in the form of stern disapproval, withdrawal of financial support, or physical or emotional abuse\\u00c2\\u2014to block her from getting an abortion. See <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 647 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\\\\\\\"[M]any parents hold strong views on the subject of abortion, and young pregnant minors, especially those living at home, are particularly vulnerable to their parents' efforts to obstruct . . . an abortion\\\\\\\"). See also <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S., at 438-439 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). In such circumstances, the notification requirement becomes, in effect, a consent requirement. As discussed below, <i>infra,</i> at 473, the State may not permit any person, including a parent, to veto a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. Because the notification and delay requirements effectively give parents the opportunity to exercise an unconstitutional veto in some situations, those requirements are not narrowly tailored to the State's interest in facilitating <i>legitimate</i> exercises of parental authority.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The parental notification and 48-hour delay requirements, then, do not satisfy the strict scrutiny applicable to laws restricting a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion. The judicial bypass procedure cannot salvage those requirements because that procedure itself is unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The State argues that the bypass procedure saves the notification and delay requirements because it provides an alternative way to obtain a legal abortion for minors who would be harmed by those requirements. This Court has upheld a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*473</span> one-parent consent requirement where the State provided an alternative judicial procedure \\\\\\\"`whereby a pregnant minor [could] demonstrate that she [was] sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests.'\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U.

It is inherent in the right to make the abortion decision that the right may be exercised without public scrutiny and in defiance of the contrary opinion of the sovereign or other third parties\\\\\\\") (footnote omitted); <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo., supra,</i> at 74 (\\\\\\\"[T]he State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent\\\\\\\"). No person may veto <i>any</i> minor's decision, made in consultation with her physician, to terminate her pregnancy. An \\\\\\\"immature\\\\\\\" minor has no less right to make decisions regarding her own body than a mature adult.</p>\\\\n<p>Minnesota's bypass provision allows a judge to authorize an abortion if he determines either that a woman is sufficiently mature to make the decision on her own or, if she is not sufficiently mature, that an abortion without parental notification would serve her best interests. Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6) (1988). Of course, if a judge refuses to authorize <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*474</span> an abortion, a young woman can then reevaluate whether she wants to notify a parent. But many women will carry the fetus to term rather than notify a parent. See <i>supra,</i> at 466-467. Other women may decide to inform a parent but then confront parental pressure or abuse so severe as to obstruct the abortion. For these women, the judge's refusal to authorize an abortion effectively constitutes an absolute veto.</p>\\\\n<p>The constitutional defects in any provision allowing someone to veto a woman's abortion decision are exacerbated by the vagueness of the standards contained in this statute. The statute gives no guidance on how a judge is to determine whether a minor is sufficiently \\\\\\\"mature\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"capable\\\\\\\" to make the decision on her own. See Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6)(c)(i) (1988) (judge shall authorize abortion if he \\\\\\\"determines that the pregnant woman is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion\\\\\\\"). Cf. Lewis, 42 American Psychologist, at 84, 87 (noting the absence of a judicial standard for assessing maturity). The statute similarly is silent as to how a judge is to determine whether an abortion without parental notification would serve an immature minor's \\\\\\\"best interests.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6) (c)(i) (judge shall authorize abortion for immature minor without notification \\\\\\\"if said judge concludes that the pregnant woman's best interests would be served thereby\\\\\\\"). Is the judge expected to know more about the woman's medical needs or psychological makeup than her doctor? Should he consider the woman's financial and emotional status to determine the quality of life the woman and her future child would enjoy in this world? Neither the record nor the Court answers such questions. As JUSTICE STEVENS wrote in <i>Bellotti II,</i> the best interest standard \\\\\\\"provides little real guidance to the judge, and his decision must necessarily reflect personal and societal values and mores whose enforcement upon the minor\\u00c2\\u2014particularly when contrary to her own informed and reasonable decision\\u00c2\\u2014is fundamentally at odds with privacy interests underlying the constitutional protection <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*475</span> afforded to her decision.\\\\\\\" 443 U. S., at 655-656 (opinion concurring in judgment). It is difficult to conceive of any reason, aside from a judge's personal opposition to abortion, that would justify a finding that an immature woman's best interests would be served by forcing her to endure pregnancy and childbirth against her will.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Even if I did not believe that a judicial bypass procedure was facially unconstitutional, the experience of Minnesota's procedure in operation demonstrates that the bypass provision before us cannot save the parental notification and delay requirements. This Court has addressed judicial bypass procedures only in the context of facial challenges. See <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City,</i> 462 U. S., at 490-493 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 462 U. S., at 439-442; <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 643-644 (opinion of Powell, J.). The Court has never considered the actual burdens a particular bypass provision imposes on a woman's right to choose an abortion. Such consideration establishes that, even if judges authorized every abortion sought by petitioning minors, Minnesota's judicial bypass is far too burdensome to remedy an otherwise unconstitutional statute.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court found that the bypass procedure imposed significant burdens on minors. First, \\\\\\\"scheduling practices in Minnesota courts typically require minors to wait two or three days between their first contact with the court and the hearing on their petitions. This delay may combine with other factors to result in a delay of a week or more.\\\\\\\" 648 F. Supp., at 763. As noted above, <i>supra,</i> at 467-468, a delay of only a few days can significantly increase the health risks to the minor; a week-long delay inevitably does. Furthermore, in several counties in Minnesota, no judge is willing to hear bypass petitions, forcing women in those areas to travel long distances to obtain a hearing. 648 F. Supp., at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*476</span> 763; Donovan, Judging Teenagers: How Minors Fare When They Seek Court-Authorized Abortions, 15 Family Planning Perspectives 259, 264 (1983) (50% of Minnesota minors utilizing bypass were not residents of city in which court was located); Melton, 42 American Psychologist, at 80 (\\\\\\\"In Minnesota, where judges in rural counties have often recused themselves from participation in the abortion hearings, minors sometimes have to travel a round-trip of more than 500 miles for the hearing\\\\\\\"). The burden of such travel, often requiring an overnight stay in a distant city, is particularly heavy for poor women from rural areas. Furthermore, a young woman's absence from home, school, or work during the time required for such travel and for the hearing itself can jeopardize the woman's confidentiality. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The District Court also found that the bypass procedure can be extremely traumatic for young women.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The experience of going to court for a judicial authorization produces fear and tension in many minors. Minors are apprehensive about the prospect of facing an authority figure who holds in his hands the power to veto their decision to proceed without notifying one or both parents. Many minors are angry and resentful at being required to justify their decision before complete strangers. Despite the confidentiality of the proceeding, many minors resent having to reveal intimate details of their personal and family lives to these strangers. Finally, many minors are left feeling guilty and ashamed about their lifestyle and their decision to terminate their pregnancy. Some mature minors and some minors in whose best interests it is to proceed without notifying their parents are so daunted by the judicial proceeding that they forego the bypass option and either notify their parents or carry to term.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Some minors are so upset by the bypass proceeding that they consider it more difficult than the medical procedure itself. Indeed the anxiety resulting from the bypass <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*477</span> proceeding may linger until the time of the medical procedure and thus render the latter more difficult than necessary.\\\\\\\" 648 F. Supp., at 763-764.<sup>[8]</sup></blockquote>\\\\n<p>Yet, despite the substantial burdens imposed by these proceedings, the bypass is, in effect, a \\\\\\\"rubber stamp,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 766 (testimony of Hon. William Sweeney); only an extremely small number of petitions are denied, <i>id.,</i> at 765. See also Melton, <i>supra,</i> at 80 (\\\\\\\"Available research indicates that judicial bypass proceedings are merely pro forma. Although they represent substantial intrusion on minors' privacy and take up significant amounts of court time, there is no evidence that they promote more reasoned decisionmaking or screen out adolescents who may be particularly immature or vulnerable. . . . The hearings typically last less than 15 minutes.. . . Despite the complex issues involved (maturity and the best interests of the minor), experts are rarely if ever called to testify\\\\\\\"). The judges who have adjudicated over 90% of the bypass petitions between 1981 and 1986 could not identify any positive effects of the bypass procedure. See 648 F. Supp., at 766; <i>ante,</i> at 441-442, and n. 29. The large number of women who undergo the bypass process do not receive any sort of counseling from the court \\u00c2\\u2014which is not surprising, given the court's limited role and lack of expertise in that area. The bypass process itself thus cannot serve the state interest of promoting informed decisionmaking by all minors. If the State truly were concerned about ensuring <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*478</span> that all minors consult with a knowledgeable and caring adult, it would provide for some form of counseling rather than for a judicial procedure in which a judge merely gives or withholds his consent.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Thus, regardless of one's view of the facial validity of a bypass procedure, Minnesota's procedure in practice imposes an excessive burden on young women's right to choose an abortion. Cf. <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 655 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (\\\\\\\"[T]he need to commence judicial proceedings in order to obtain a legal abortion would impose a burden at least as great as, and probably greater than, that imposed on the minor child by the need to obtain the consent of a parent\\\\\\\"). Furthermore, the process does not serve the State's interest of ensuring that minors' decisions are informed. Surely, then, a State could not require that <i>all</i> minor women seeking an abortion obtain judicial approval.<sup>[10]</sup> The Court's holding that the burdensome bypass procedure saves the State's burdensome notification and delay requirements <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*479</span> thus strikes me as the equivalent of saying that two wrongs make a right. I cannot accept such a novel judicial calculus.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>A majority of the Court today strikes down an unreasonable and vastly overbroad requirement that a pregnant minor notify both her parents of her decision to obtain an abortion. With that decision I agree. At the same time, though, a different majority holds that a State may require a young woman to notify one or even both parents and then wait 48 hours before having an abortion, as long as the State provides a judicial bypass procedure. From that decision I vehemently dissent. This scheme forces a young woman in an already dire situation to choose between two fundamentally unacceptable alternatives: notifying a possibly dictatorial or even abusive parent and justifying her profoundly personal decision in an intimidating judicial proceeding to a blackrobed stranger. For such a woman, this dilemma is more likely to result in trauma and pain than in an informed and voluntary decision.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>As I understand the various opinions today: One Justice holds that two-parent notification is unconstitutional (at least in the present circumstances) without judicial bypass, but constitutional with bypass, <i>ante,</i> at 459-461 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); four Justices would hold that two-parent notification is constitutional with or without bypass, <i>post,</i> at 488-497 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); four Justices would hold that two-parent notification is unconstitutional with or without bypass, though the four apply two different standards, <i>ante,</i> at 455-458 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), <i>ante,</i> at 472-479 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*480</span> six Justices hold that one-parent notification with bypass is constitutional, though for two different sets of reasons, <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post,</i> at 510-517; <i>post,</i> at 522-524 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); and three Justices would hold that one-parent notification with bypass is unconstitutional, <i>post,</i> at 526-527 (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). One will search in vain the document we are supposed to be construing for text that provides the basis for the argument over these distinctions; and will find in our society's tradition regarding abortion no hint that the distinctions are constitutionally relevant, much less any indication how a constitutional argument about them ought to be resolved. The random and unpredictable results of our consequently unchanneled individual views make it increasingly evident, Term after Term, that the tools for this job are not to be found in the lawyer's \\u00c2\\u2014and hence not in the judge's \\u00c2\\u2014workbox. I continue to dissent from this enterprise of devising an Abortion Code, and from the illusion that we have authority to do so.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE SCALIA join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"`There can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child. That is a grave decision, and a girl of tender years, under emotional stress, may be ill-equipped to make it without mature advice and emotional support.'\\\\\\\" <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird (Bellotti II),</i> 443 U. S. 622, 640-641 (1979) (opinion of Powell, J.) (quoting <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 91 (1976) (Stewart, J., concurring)); see also <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S. 398, 409-411 (1981); <i>id.,</i> at 422-423 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 94-95 (WHITE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 102-103 (STEVENS, J., concurring in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*481</span> part and dissenting in part). Today, the Court holds that a statute requiring a minor to notify both parents that she plans to have an abortion is not a permissible means of furthering the interest described with such specificity in <i>Bellotti II.</i> This conclusion, which no doubt will come as a surprise to most parents, is incompatible with our constitutional tradition and any acceptable notion of judicial review of legislative enactments. I dissent from the portion of the Court's judgment affirming the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Minnesota two-parent notice statute is unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>The Minnesota statute also provides, however, that if the two-parent notice requirement is invalidated, the same notice requirement is effective unless the pregnant minor obtains a court order permitting the abortion to proceed. Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6) (1988). The Court of Appeals sustained this portion of the statute, in effect a two-parent notice requirement with a judicial bypass. Five Members of the Court, the four who join this opinion and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, agree with the Court of Appeals' decision on this aspect of the statute. As announced by JUSTICE STEVENS, who dissents from this part of the Court's decision, the Court of Appeals' judgment on this portion of the statute is therefore affirmed.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>The provisions of the statute before us are straightforward. In essence, the statute provides that before a physician in Minnesota may perform an abortion on an unemancipated minor, the physician or the physician's agent must notify both of the minor's parents, if each one can be located through reasonable effort, either personally or by certified mail at least 48 hours before the abortion is performed. Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(2)-(3) (1988). Notification is not required if the abortion is necessary to prevent the minor's death; or if both parents have consented to the abortion; or if the minor declares that she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(4). Failure to comply <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*482</span> with these requirements is a misdemeanor, and the statute authorizes a civil action against the noncomplying physician by the minor's parents. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(5).</p>\\\\n<p>The statute also provides that, if a court enjoins the notice requirement of subdivision 2, parental notice under the subdivision shall still be required, unless the minor obtains a court order dispensing with it. Under the statute, the court is required to authorize the physician to perform the abortion without parental notice if the court determines that the minor is \\\\\\\"mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion\\\\\\\" or that \\\\\\\"the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parents, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The State identifies two interests served by the law. The first is the State's interest in the welfare of pregnant minors. The second is the State's interest in acknowledging and promoting the role of parents in the care and upbringing of their children. JUSTICE STEVENS, writing for two Members of the Court, acknowledges the legitimacy of the first interest, but decides that the second interest is somehow illegitimate, at least as to whichever parent a minor chooses not to notify. I cannot agree that the Constitution prevents a State from keeping both parents informed of the medical condition or medical treatment of their child under the terms and conditions of this statute.</p>\\\\n<p>The welfare of the child has always been the central concern of laws with regard to minors. The law does not give to children many rights given to adults, and provides, in general, that children can exercise the rights they do have only through and with parental consent. <i>Parham</i> v. <i>J. R.,</i> 442 U. S. 584, 621 (1979) (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). Legislatures historically have acted on the basis of the qualitative differences in maturity between children and adults, see <i>Schall</i> v. <i>Martin,</i> 467 U. S. 253, 265-267 (1984); <i>Thompson</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*483</span> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 487 U. S. 815, 853-854 (1988) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (collecting cases); <i>Stanford</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 492 U. S. 361, 384 (1989) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), and not without reason. Age is a rough but fair approximation of maturity and judgment, and a State has an interest in seeing that a child, when confronted with serious decisions such as whether or not to abort a pregnancy, has the assistance of her parents in making the choice. If anything is settled by our previous cases dealing with parental notification and consent laws, it is this point. See <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 640-641 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S., at 409-411; <i>id.,</i> at 422-423 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\\\\n<p>Protection of the right of each parent to participate in the upbringing of her or his own children is a further discrete interest that the State recognizes by the statute. The common law historically has given recognition to the right of parents, not merely to be notified of their children's actions, but to speak and act on their behalf. Absent a showing of neglect or abuse, a father \\\\\\\"possessed the paramount right to the custody and control of his minor children, and to superintend their education and nurture.\\\\\\\" J. Schouler, Law of Domestic Relations 337 (3d. ed. 1882); see also 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *452-*453; 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *203-*206; G. Field, Legal Relations of Infants 63-80 (1888). In this century, the common law of most States has abandoned the idea that parental rights are vested solely in fathers, with mothers being viewed merely as agents of their husbands, cf. <i>ante,</i> at 446, n. 32; it is now the case that each parent has parental rights and parental responsibilities, see W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts, ch. 4, \\u00c2\\u00a7 18, p. 115 (5th ed. 1984). Limitations have emerged on the prerogatives of parents to act contrary to the best interests of the child with respect to matters such as compulsory schooling and child labor. As a general matter, however, it remains <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*484</span> \\\\\\\"cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\\\\\\\" <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944). \\\\\\\"The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.\\\\\\\" <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder,</i> 406 U. S. 205, 232 (1972); see also <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510, 535 (1925).</p>\\\\n<p>A State pursues a legitimate end under the Constitution when it attempts to foster and preserve the parent-child relationship by giving all parents the opportunity to participate in the care and nurture of their children. We have held that parents have a liberty interest, protected by the Constitution, in having a reasonable opportunity to develop close relations with their children. See <i>Santosky</i> v. <i>Kramer,</i> 455 U. S. 745, 753-754 (1982); <i>Caban</i> v. <i>Mohammed,</i> 441 U. S. 380 (1979); <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645, 651-652 (1972). We have recognized, of course, that there are limits to the constitutional right of parents to have custody of, or to participate in decisions affecting, their children. If a parent has relinquished the opportunity to develop a relationship with the child, and his or her only link to the child is biological, the Constitution does not require a State to allow parental participation. See <i>Lehr</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 463 U. S. 248, 261-265 (1983); <i>Quilloin</i> v. <i>Walcott,</i> 434 U. S. 246, 254-256 (1978). But the fact that the Constitution does not protect the parent-child relationship in all circumstances does not mean that the State cannot attempt to foster parental participation where the Constitution does not demand that it do so. A State may seek to protect and facilitate the parent-child bond on the assumption that parents will act in their child's best interests. See <i>Parham</i> v. <i>J. R., supra,</i> at 602-603; <i>Ginsberg</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 390 U. S. 629, 639 (1968). Indeed, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*485</span> we have held that a State cannot terminate parental rights based upon a presumption that a class of parents is unfit without affording individual parents an opportunity to rebut the presumption. See <i>Stanley, supra,</i> at 654-658; <i>Santosky, supra,</i> at 753 (\\\\\\\"The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents . . .\\\\\\\"). If a State cannot legislate on the broad assumption that classes of parents are unfit and undeserving of parental rights without affording an opportunity to rebut the assumption, it is at least permissible for a State to legislate on the premise that parents, as a general rule, are interested in their children's welfare and will act in accord with it.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's descriptions of the State's interests in this case are caricatures, both of the law and of our most revered institutions. The Court labels these interests as ones in \\\\\\\"standardizing its children and adults,\\\\\\\" and in ensuring that each family, to the extent possible, \\\\\\\"conform to some state-designed ideal.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 452; see also <i>ante,</i> at 471 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (accusing Minnesota of \\\\\\\"trying to force families to conform to the State's archetype of the ideal family\\\\\\\"). Minnesota asserts no such purpose, by explicit statement or by any permissible inference. All that Minnesota asserts is an interest in seeing that parents know about a vital decision facing their child. That interest is a valid one without regard to whether the child is living with either one or both parents, or to the attachment between the minor's parents. How the family unit responds to such notice is, for the most part, beyond the State's control. The State would no doubt prefer that all parents, after being notified under the statute, would contact their daughters and assist them in making their decisions with the child's best interests at heart; but it has not, contrary to the Court's intimation, \\\\\\\"decreed\\\\\\\" communication, nor could it. What <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*486</span> the State can do is make the communication possible by at least informing parents of their daughter's intentions.</p>\\\\n<p>Minnesota has done no more than act upon the commonsense proposition that, in assisting their daughter in deciding whether to have an abortion, parents can best fulfill their roles if they have the same information about their own child's medical condition and medical choices as the child's doctor does; and that to deny parents this knowledge is to risk, or perpetuate, estrangement or alienation from the child when she is in the greatest need of parental guidance and support. The Court does the State, and our constitutional tradition, sad disservice by impugning the legitimacy of these elemental objectives.</p>\\\\n<p>Given the societal interest that underlies parental notice and consent laws, it comes as no surprise that most States have enacted statutes requiring that, in general, a physician must notify or obtain the consent of at least one of her parents or legal guardian before performing an abortion on a minor. See Wardle, \\\\\\\"Time Enough\\\\\\\": <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services</i> and the Prudent Pace of Justice, 41 Fla. L. Rev. 881, 963-965 (1989) (collecting statutes). Five States, including Minnesota, appear to require, as a general rule, the notification of both parents before a physician may perform an abortion on a minor. See Ark. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 20-16-801 through XX-XX-XXX (Supp. 1989); Idaho Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 18-610 (6) (1987); Tenn. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 39-15-202(f) (Supp. 1989); Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 76-7-304 (1990). Another six States appear to require, with varying exceptions, the consent of both parents. See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 24, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1790(b)(3) (1987); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \\u00c2\\u00b6 81-54(3) (1989); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 311.732 (Michie 1990); Mass. Gen. Laws \\u00c2\\u00a7 112:12S (1988); Miss. Code. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 41-41-53 (Supp. 1989); N. D. Cent. Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 14-02.1-03.1 (1981). Whether these statutes are more or less restrictive than the Minnesota statute is not the issue, although I pause to note that because the Court's decision today turns upon its perception that the law's requirements, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*487</span> despite its exceptions, are the most \\\\\\\"stringent\\\\\\\" in the country, see <i>ante,</i> at 459 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), the. Court's decision has no import for the validity of these other statutes. What is important is that Minnesota is not alone in acknowledging the vitality of these governmental interests and adopting laws that, in the legislature's judgment, are best suited to serving them while protecting the minor's welfare.</p>\\\\n<p>On a more general level, the current trend among state legislatures is to enact joint custody laws making it the norm for divorced or separated parents to share the legal responsibility and authority for making decisions concerning their children's care, education, religion, and medical treatment. See 2 H. Clark, Law of Domestic Relations in the United States \\u00c2\\u00a7 20.5 (2d ed. 1987); Folberg, Joint Custody Law \\u00c2\\u2014 The Second Wave, 23 J. Family L. 1, 14-55 (1984-1985) (collecting statutes). Under Minnesota law, for example, there exists a presumption in divorce proceedings that joint custody, if requested by either or both parents, is in the best interests of the child. See Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 518.17(2) (Supp. 1989). Even if joint custody is not awarded, Minnesota law provides that each parent, unless the court specifically directs otherwise to protect the welfare of a parent or the child, \\\\\\\"has the right of access to, and to receive copies of, school, medical, dental, religious training, and other important records and information about the minor children\\\\\\\"; the responsibility to \\\\\\\"keep the other party informed as to the name and address of the school of attendance of the minor children\\\\\\\"; the responsibility to \\\\\\\"notify the other party of [an accident or serious illness of a minor child], and the name of the health care provider and the place of treatment\\\\\\\"; and \\\\\\\"the right to reasonable access and telephone contact with the minor children.\\\\\\\" Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 518.17(3) (1988). Minnesota's two-parent notification law does no more than apply these general principles to the specific case of abortion.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*488</span> Federal law contains similar provisions regulating the health and welfare of children that require the notification or consent of both parents. For example, one condition for obtaining a grant under the Adolescent Family Life Act is that an applicant must provide assurances that it will \\\\\\\"notify the parents or guardians of any unemancipated minor requesting services [relating to family planning] from the applicant and. . . will obtain the permission of such parents or guardians with respect to the provision of such services.\\\\\\\" 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 300z-5(a)(22)(A)(i) (1982 ed.); see \\u00c2\\u00a7 300z-5(a)(22)(A)(ii) (requiring only notice to parents or guardians if the unemancipated minor is preguant). See also 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 5671(d) (1982 ed., Supp. V) (authorizing funding for certain experimental juvenile drug and alcohol treatment programs if safeguards are established for obtaining the informed consent of the \\\\\\\"parents or guardians\\\\\\\" of minors); 50 U. S. C. App. \\u00c2\\u00a7 454(c)(4) (1982 ed.) (permitting induction of a 17-year-old into the Armed Forces with the written consent of his \\\\\\\"parents or guardian\\\\\\\"); 45 CFR \\u00c2\\u00a7 46.408 (1989) (requiring consent of both parents before a minor may participate in medical research posing more than a \\\\\\\"minimal\\\\\\\" risk of harm). With all respect, I submit the Court today errs when it states that Minnesota's two-parent notice law is an \\\\\\\"oddity among state and federal consent provisions.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 454.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>At least two Members of the Court concede, as they must, that a State has a legitimate interest in the welfare of the pregnant minor and that, in furtherance of this interest, the State may require the minor to notify, and consult with, one of her parents. See <i>ante,</i> at 444-446 (opinion of STEVENS, J.); cf. <i>ante,</i> at 469 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part). The Court nonetheless holds the Minnesota statute unconstitutional because it requires the minor to notify not one parent, but both parents, a requirement that the Court says bears <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*489</span> no reasonable relation to the minor's welfare. See <i>ante,</i> at 450-455; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 469-472 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part). The Court also concludes that Minnesota does not have a legitimate interest in facilitating the participation of both parents in the care and upbringing of their children. Given the substantial protection that minors have under Minnesota law generally, and under the statute in question, the judicial bypass provisions of the law are not necessary to its validity. The two-parent notification law enacted by Minnesota is, in my view, valid without the judicial bypass provision of subdivision 6.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>We have been over much of this ground before. It is beyond dispute that in many families, whether the parents are living together or apart, notice to both parents serves the interests of the parents and the minor, and that the State can legislate with this fact in mind. In <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S. 398 (1981), we considered the constitutionality of a statute which required a physician, before performing an abortion on a minor, to \\\\\\\"`[n]otify, if possible, the [minor's] <i>parents</i> or guardian.'\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 400 (quoting Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 76-7-304 (1978)) (emphasis added). We held that the statute, as applied to unmarried, dependent, and immature minors, \\\\\\\"plainly serves important state interests, is narrowly drawn to protect only those interests, and does not violate any guarantees of the Constitution.\\\\\\\" 450 U. S., at 413. Our holding was made with knowledge of the contentions, supported by citations to medical and sociological literature, that are proffered again today for the proposition that notification imposes burdens on minors. See <i>id.,</i> at 436-441 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). We nonetheless rejected arguments that a requirement of parental notification was the equivalent of a requirement of parental consent, <i>id.,</i> at 411; that the statute was unconstitutional because it required notification only as to abortions, and not as to other medical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*490</span> procedures, <i>id.,</i> at 412; and that the statute was unconstitutional because it might deter some minors from seeking abortions, <i>id.,</i> at 413.</p>\\\\n<p>Our decision was based upon the well-accepted premise that we must defer to a reasonable judgment by the state legislature when it determines what is sound public policy. JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion concurring in the Court's judgment relied upon an explicit statement of this principle. Concluding that the Utah statute requiring notification of both parents was valid as to all unmarried minors, both mature and immature, JUSTICE STEVENS reasoned that the State's interest in ensuring that a young woman considering an abortion receive appropriate consultation was \\\\\\\"plainly sufficient to support a state legislature's determination that such appropriate consultation should include parental advice.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 423. The Court today departs from this rule. It now suggests that a general requirement that both parents be notified is unconstitutional because of its own conclusion that the law is unnecessary when notice produces favorable results, see <i>ante,</i> at 450, and irrational in all of the instances when it produces unfavorable results, see <i>ante,</i> at 450-451. In <i>Matheson,</i> JUSTICE STEVENS rejected these same arguments as insufficient to establish that the Utah statute was unconstitutional:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Of course, a conclusion that the Utah statute is invalid would not prevent young pregnant women from voluntarily seeking the advice of their parents prior to making the abortion decision. But the State may legitimately decide that such consultation should be made more probable by ensuring that parents are informed of their daughter's decision . . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>.....</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Utah's interest in its parental-notice statute is not diminished by the fact that there can be no guarantee that meaningful parent-child communication will actually occur. Good-faith compliance with the statute's requirements <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*491</span> would tend to facilitate communication between daughters and parents regarding the abortion decision. <i>The possibility that some parents will not react with compassion and understanding upon being informed of their daughter's predicament or that, even if they are receptive, they will incorrectly advise her, does not undercut the legitimacy of the State's attempt to establish a procedure that will enhance the probability that a pregnant young woman exercise as wisely as possible her right to make the abortion decision.\\\\\\\"</i> 450 U. S., at 423-424 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS' reasoning was correct then, and it remains correct today.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>In applying the standards established in our prior decisions to the cases at hand, \\\\\\\"we must keep in mind that when we are concerned with extremely sensitive issues, such as the one involved here, `the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature. We should not forget that \\\\\\\"legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\\\\\\\" <i>Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co.</i> v. <i>May,</i> 194 U. S. 267, 270 (1904) (Holmes, J.).' <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, 479-480 (1977) (footnote omitted).\\\\\\\" <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 465 (1983) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Minnesota Legislature, like the legislatures of many States, has found it necessary to address the issue of parental notice in its statutory laws. In my view it has acted in a permissible manner.</p>\\\\n<p>All must acknowledge that it was reasonable for the legislature to conclude that in most cases notice to both parents will work to the minor's benefit. See <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 640, n. 20 (opinion of Powell, J.) (parental involvement, if compassionate and supportive, is highly desirable). This is true not only in what the Court calls the \\\\\\\"ideal family setting,\\\\\\\" where both parents and the minor live under one roof, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*492</span> but also where the minor no longer lives with both parents. The Court does not deny that many absent parents maintain significant ties with their children, and seek to participate in their lives, to guide, to teach, and to care for them. It is beyond dispute that these attachments, in cases not involving mistreatment or abuse, are essential to the minor's wellbeing, and that parental notice is supportive of this kind of family tie. Although it may be true that notice to one parent will often result in notice to both, the State need not rely upon the decision of one parent to notify the other, particularly where both parents maintain ties with their daughter but not with each other, and when both parents share responsibilities and duties with respect to the child.</p>\\\\n<p>I acknowledge that in some cases notifying both parents will not produce desirable results despite the fact that no actual instance is in the record before us, as the two-parent notification requirement was enjoined before it went into effect. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 438 (stating as a matter of historical fact that the \\\\\\\"two-parent notification requirement <i>had</i> particularly harmful effects on both the minor and the custodial parent\\\\\\\" and that fears that notification of an absent parent would produce harmful results <i>\\\\\\\"were</i> often realized\\\\\\\") (emphasis added). We need not decide today, however, whether the Constitution permits a State to require that a physician notify both biological parents before performing an abortion on any minor, for the simple reason that Minnesota has not enacted such a law.</p>\\\\n<p>The Minnesota statute in fact contains exceptions to ensure that the statutory notice requirement does not apply if it proves a serious threat to the minor's health or safety. First, the statute does not require notice at all costs; to comply with the law, a physician need only use \\\\\\\"reasonably diligent effort\\\\\\\" to locate and notify both of the minor's parents. If the second parent cannot be located, as may be the case if the parent has deserted the family or ceased to maintain contact with the minor or the other parent, the only notice required is to the first parent. Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(3) (1988).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*493</span> Second, even where both parents can be located, notice is not required if the physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to prevent the woman's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice, \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(4)(a); if the minor's parents have authorized the abortion in writing, \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(4)(b); or if the minor declares that she is the victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse, \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(4)(c). Under Minnesota law, \\\\\\\"neglect\\\\\\\" of a minor means the failure of a parent \\\\\\\"to supply a child with necessary food, clothing, shelter or medical care when reasonably able to do so or failure to protect a child from conditions or actions which imminently and seriously endanger the child's physical or mental health when reasonably able to do so,\\\\\\\" Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556 (2)(c) (Supp. 1989); physical abuse is defined as \\\\\\\"any physical injury inflicted by a person responsible for the child's care on a child other than by accidental means,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556(2)(d); and sexual abuse includes any sexual contact by a parent or other person responsible for the child's care or in a position of authority with respect to the child, \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556(2)(a). I cannot believe that these exceptions are too narrow to eliminate from the statute's coverage those instances in which notice would place the minor in danger of parental violence or other conduct that is a real threat to the physical or mental health of the child.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court challenges the efficacy of this last exception because it believes that the statutory requirement that a physician report a minor's declaration of abuse to appropriate authorities, see Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(4)(c) (1988), will deter minors from using the exception. This is not a proper basis for declaring the law invalid. Laws are not declared unconstitutional because of some general reluctance to follow a statutory scheme the legislature finds necessary to accomplish a legitimate state objective. Beyond any question it is reasonable for the State to require that physicians report declarations of abuse to ensure that mistreatment is known to authorities responsible for the protection of minors. This <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*494</span> requirement is but a single manifestation of the broad duty in Minnesota to report suspected cases of child abuse to the proper authorities. See Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556(1) (1988) (declaring it to be the public policy of the State \\\\\\\"to protect children whose health or welfare may be jeopardized through physical abuse, neglect or sexual abuse\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"to strengthen the family and make the home, school, and community safer for children by promoting responsible child care in all settings\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>No one can contend that a minor who is pregnant is somehow less deserving of the State's protection. It is reasonable to provide that any minor who contends that she cannot notify her parent or parents because she is the victim of neglect or abuse must allow the State to use its power to investigate her declaration and protect her from harm. Any parent, moreover, who responds to notice by threatening or harming the minor or the other parent may be prosecuted by the State to the full extent of its laws. See Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 518B.01 (1988) (Domestic Abuse Act); Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 609.221, 609.222, 609.223, 609.224 (1988 and Supp. 1989) (assault statutes); \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 609.341 through 609.345 (sexual abuse statutes); \\u00c2\\u00a7 609.378 (criminal neglect statute). Just as it relies upon such laws as its first line of defense for dealing with all other instances of abuse in family situations, so too is the State entitled to rely upon them here.</p>\\\\n<p>Notwithstanding the exceptions and protections we have discussed, it does remain possible, of course, that in some instances notifying one or both parents will not be in the minor's best interests. Allegations of a similar possibility, based upon sociological evidence similar to that presented in these cases, was made by the appellant in <i>Matheson.</i> See Brief for Appellant in <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1980, No. 79-5903, pp. 10-11; Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., et al., as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in <i>Matheson</i> 16-31. The Court there held that the parental notification law was valid, at least as to immature minors, for the simple reason that a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*495</span> law is not invalid if it fails to further the governmental interest in every instance. This point formed the cornerstone of JUSTICE STEVENS' concurring opinion in <i>Matheson,</i> see 450 U. S., at 423-424, and it finds its most explicit statement in the Court's opinion in <i>Parham</i> v. <i>J. R.,</i> 442 U. S., at 602-603:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions. More importantly, historically, it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"As with so many other legal presumptions, experience and reality may rebut what the law accepts as a starting point; the incidence of child neglect and abuse cases attest to this. That some parents `may at times be acting against the best interests of their children' . . . creates a basis for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interests.\\\\\\\"</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The only cases in which a majority of the Court has deviated from this principle are those in which a State sought to condition a minor's access to abortion services upon receipt of her parent's consent to do so. In <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), the Court invalidated a Missouri law requiring that a physician obtain the consent of one parent before performing an abortion. The Court's reasoning was unmistakable: \\\\\\\"[T]he State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 74. The Court today, ignoring this statement, relies heavily upon isolated passages from <i>Danforth,</i> see <i>ante,</i> at 452-453, and other cases involving parental consent laws, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*496</span> see, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 453 (citing <i>Bellotti II</i>). JUSTICE MARSHALL, on the other hand, expressly equates laws requiring parental consent with laws requiring parental notification, see <i>ante,</i> at 471-472 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>The difference between notice and consent was apparent to us before and is apparent now. Unlike parental consent laws, a law requiring parental notice does not give any third party the legal right to make the minor's decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortion should she choose to have one performed. We have acknowledged this distinction as \\\\\\\"fundamental,\\\\\\\" and as one \\\\\\\"substantially modify[ing] the federal constitutional challenge.\\\\\\\" <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird (Bellotti I),</i> 428 U. S. 132, 145, 148 (1976); see also <i>Matheson, supra,</i> at 411, n. 17. The law before us does not place an absolute obstacle before any minor seeking to obtain an abortion, and it represents a considered weighing of the competing interests of minors and their parents.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"It cannot be doubted that as long as a state statute is within `the bounds of reason and [does not] assum[e] the character of a merely arbitrary fiat . . . [then] [t]he State . . . must decide upon measures that are needful for the protection of its people . . . .'\\\\\\\" <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S., at 459 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Purity Extract &amp; Tonic Co.</i> v. <i>Lynch,</i> 226 U. S. 192, 204-205 (1912)). Like all laws of general application, the Minnesota statute cannot produce perfect results in every situation to which it applies; but the State is under no obligation to enact perfect laws. The statute before us, including the 48-hour waiting period, which is necessary to enable notified parents to consult with their daughter or their daughter's physician, if they so wish, and results in little or no delay, represents a permissible, reasoned attempt to preserve the parents' role in a minor's decision to have an abortion without placing any absolute obstacles before a minor who is determined to elect an abortion for her own interest as she sees it. Section 144.343, without the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*497</span> judicial bypass provision of subdivision 6, is constitutional. I would reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>Because a majority of the Court holds that the two-parent notice requirement contained in subdivision 2 is unconstitutional, it is necessary for the Court to consider whether the same notice requirement is constitutional if the minor has the option of obtaining a court order permitting the abortion to proceed in lieu of the required notice. Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343 (6) (1988). Assuming, as I am bound to do for this part of the analysis, that the notice provisions standing alone are invalid, I conclude that the two-parent notice requirement with the judicial bypass alternative is constitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court concludes that Minnesota's two-parent notice law without a judicial bypass is unconstitutional because of the possibility that, in some cases, the rule would not work to the benefit of minors or their parents. If one were to attempt to design a statute that would address the Court's concerns, one would do precisely what Minnesota has done in \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6): create a judicial mechanism to identify, and exempt from the strictures of the law, those cases in which the minor is mature or in which notification of the minor's parents is not in the minor's best interests. The bypass procedure comports in all respects with our precedents. See <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 643-644 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476, 491 (1983) (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 505 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post,</i> p. 502.</p>\\\\n<p>In providing for the bypass, Minnesota has done nothing other than attempt to fit its legislation into the framework that we have supplied in our previous cases. The simple fact is that our decision in <i>Bellotti II</i> stands for the proposition that a two-parent consent law is constitutional if it provides <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*498</span> for a sufficient judicial bypass alternative, and it requires us to sustain the statute before us here. In <i>Bellotti II,</i> the Court considered the constitutionality of a statute which required a physician to obtain, in most circumstances, the consent of both of a minor's parents before performing an abortion on the minor. See 443 U. S., at 625-626 (opinion of Powell, J.) (citing Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann., ch. 112, \\u00c2\\u00a7 12S (West Supp. 1979)). Although eight Members of the Court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional, five indicated that they would uphold a two-parent consent statute with an adequate judicial bypass.</p>\\\\n<p>For four of the eight Justices forming the majority in <i>Bellotti II,</i> the failure of the statute lay in its inadequate bypass procedure, not its requirement that both of the minor's parents consent to the abortion. See 443 U. S., at 643 (opinion of Powell, J.). Justice Powell's opinion specifically stated that \\\\\\\"if the State decides to require a pregnant minor to obtain <i>one or both</i> parents' consent to an abortion, it also must provide an alternative procedure whereby authorization for the abortion can be obtained,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> (emphasis added; footnote omitted), and then stated the minimum requirements for such a procedure. In response to the dissent's contention that his opinion was advisory, Justice Powell stated that the four Members of the Court thought it necessary</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"to provide some guidance as to how a State constitutionally may provide for adult involvement \\u00c2\\u2014 either by parents or a state official such as a judge\\u00c2\\u2014in the abortion decision of minors. In view of the importance of the issue raised, and the protracted litigation to which these parties already have been subjected, we think it would be irresponsible simply to invalidate [the Massachusetts law] without stating our views as to the controlling principles.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 652, n. 32.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>See also <i>id.,</i> at 651-652 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring) (joining Justice Powell's opinion because \\\\\\\"unless and until [the Court is willing to overrule <i>Danforth</i>], literally thousands of judges <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*499</span> cannot be left with nothing more than the guidance offered by a truly fragmented holding of this Court\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE dissented from the Court's judgment that the Massachusetts statute was unconstitutional. In his view no bypass was necessary, so it must follow that a two-parent consent statute with an adequate bypass procedure would have been valid. See <i>id.,</i> at 656-657. In sum, five Members of the Court in <i>Bellotti II</i> found, either by express statement or by implication, that it was permissible under the Constitution for a State to require the consent of two parents, as long as it provides a consent substitute in the form of an adequate judicial bypass procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>I cannot accept JUSTICE STEVENS' suggestion today that Justice Powell, in announcing these rules, did not \\\\\\\"conside[r]\\\\\\\" the fact that he was doing so in the context of a two-parent consent requirement, see <i>ante,</i> at 455-456. The statute was explicit in its command that both parents consent to the abortion. See 443 U. S., at 625-626. Justice Powell indicated that he was aware of this fact, see <i>id.,</i> at 630, and n. 10, and the dissent drew a specific contrast between the two-parent consent requirement then before the Court and the one-parent consent requirement before the Court in <i>Danforth,</i> see 443 U. S., at 656-657 (opinion of WHITE, J.); see also <i>id.,</i> at 653 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Aware of all of these circumstances, Justice Powell stated the controlling principles with specific reference to laws requiring the consent of \\\\\\\"one or both\\\\\\\" parents. <i>Id.,</i> at 643. Justice Powell's considered reasoning, coupled with the dissenting views of JUSTICE WHITE, was intended to set forth the dispositive principles of law for deciding the constitutionality of parental consent laws. The Court has relied upon these principles in deciding the constitutionality of laws requiring notice or the consent of one parent, see <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S., at 439-442 (consent); <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, post,</i> at 511-514 (notice). As <i>Bellotti II</i> dealt with the far more demanding <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*500</span> requirement of two-parent consent, and approved of such a requirement when coupled with a judicial bypass alternative, I must conclude that these same principles validate a two-parent notice requirement when coupled with a judicial bypass alternative.</p>\\\\n<p>A second precedent that compels the conclusion that a two-parent notice law with a judicial bypass alternative is constitutional is our decision in <i>Matheson.</i> There we held that a two-parent notice statute without a bypass was constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests would be served by notice. Like the statute before the Court in <i>Matheson,</i> the Minnesota statute, as amended by subdivision 6, requires a physician to notify the parents of those immature minors whose best interest will be served by the communication.</p>\\\\n<p>If a two-parent notification law may be constitutional as applied to immature minors whose best interests are served by the law, but not as applied to minors who are mature or whose best interests are not so served, a judicial bypass is an expeditious and efficient means by which to separate the applications of the law which are constitutional from those which are not. JUSTICE STEVENS' characterization of the judicial bypass procedure discussed in our past cases as a necessary \\\\\\\"exception\\\\\\\" to a \\\\\\\"reasonable general rule,\\\\\\\" such as a one-parent consent requirement, see <i>ante,</i> at 456, 457, is far off the mark. If a judicial bypass is mandated by the Constitution at all, it must be because a general consent rule is unreasonable in at least some of its applications, and the bypass is necessary to save the statute. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Bellotti II, supra,</i> at 643 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S., at 420 (Powell, J., concurring). No reason can be given for refusing to apply a similar analysis to the less demanding case of a notice statute. It follows that a similar result should obtain: A law that requires notice to one or both parents is constitutional with a bypass. I thus concur in that portion of the judgment announced, but not agreed with, by JUSTICE STEVENS <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*501</span> which affirms the Court of Appeals' conclusion that \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(6) is constitutional.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>V</h2>\\\\n<p>In this case, the Court rejects a legislature's judgment that parents should at least be aware of their daughter's intention to seek an abortion, even if the State does not empower the parents to control the child's decision. That judgment is rejected although it rests upon a tradition of a parental role in the care and upbringing of children that is as old as civilization itself. Our precedents do not permit this result.</p>\\\\n<p>It is true that for all too many young women the prospect of two parents, perhaps even one parent, sustaining her with support that is compassionate and committed is an illusion. Statistics on drug and alcohol abuse by parents and documentations of child neglect and mistreatment are but fragments of the evidence showing the tragic reality that becomes day-to-day life for thousands of minors. But the Court errs in serious degree when it commands its own solution to the cruel consequences of individual misconduct, parental failure, and social ills. The legislative authority is entitled to attempt to meet these wrongs by taking reasonable measures to recognize and promote the primacy of the family tie, a concept which this Court now seems intent on declaring a constitutional irrelevance.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]  Together with No. 88-1309, <i>Minnesota et al.</i> v. <i>Hodgson et al.,</i> also on certiorari to the same court.</p>\\\\n<p>[\\u00c2\\u2020]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the American Psychological Association et al. by <i>Donald N.

App. 1985), we have no reason to question the State's representation that Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 144.341 and 144.342 (1988) apply to the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy. Brief for Respondents in No. 88-1125, p. 2, n. 2. Those sections provide that a minor who is living separate and apart from her parents or who is either married or has borne a child may give effective consent to medical services without the consent of any other person.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>The notification statute also applies to a woman for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed because of a finding of incompetency. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(2). This portion of the statute is not challenged in this case.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  Subdivision 2 provides:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.02, subdivision 8, no abortion operation shall be performed upon an unemancipated minor . . . . until at least 48 hours after written notice of the pending operation has been delivered in the manner specified in subdivisions 2 to 4.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(a) The notice shall be addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of the parent and delivered personally to the parent by the physician or an agent.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(b) In lieu of the delivery required by clause (a), notice shall be made by certified mail addressed to the parent at the usual place of abode of the parent with return receipt requested and restricted delivery to the addressee which means postal employee can only deliver the mail to the authorized addressee. Time of delivery shall be deemed to occur at 12 o'clock noon on the next day on which regular mail delivery takes place, subsequent to mailing.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  The Minnesota statute is the most intrusive in the Nation. Of the 38 States that require parental participation in the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy, 27 make express that the participation of only one parent is required. An additional three States, Idaho, Tennessee, and Utah, require an unmarried minor to notify \\\\\\\"the parents or guardian\\\\\\\" but do not specify whether \\\\\\\"parents\\\\\\\" refers to either member of the parental unit or whether notice to one parent constitutes constructive notice to both. See Idaho Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 18-609(6) (1987); Tenn. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 39-15-202(f) (Supp. 1989); Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 76-7-304(2) (1990). In contrast, Arkansas does require an unmarried minor to notify both parents but provides exceptions where the second parent \\\\\\\"cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort,\\\\\\\" or a parent's \\\\\\\"whereabouts are unknown,\\\\\\\" the parent has not been in contact with the minor's custodial parent or the minor for at least one year, or the parent is guilty of sexual abuse. Ark. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 20-16-802, 20-16-808 (Supp. 1989). Delaware requires the consent only of parents who are residing in the same household; if the minor is not living with both of her parents, the consent of one parent is sufficient. Del. Code. Ann., Tit. 24, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1790(b)(3) (1987). Illinois law does not require the consent of a parent who has deserted the family or is not available. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, \\u00c2\\u00b6 81-54(3) (1989). Kentucky requires an unmarried minor to obtain the consent of a legal guardian or \\\\\\\"both parents, if available,\\\\\\\" but provides that if both parents are not available, the consent of the available parent shall suffice. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 311.732(2)(a), (b) (Michie 1990). Under Massachusetts law, an unmarried minor need obtain the consent of only one parent if the other parent \\\\\\\"is unavailable to the physician within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner,\\\\\\\" or if the parents are divorced and the other parent does not have custody. Mass. Gen. Laws \\u00c2\\u00a7 112:12S (1988). Mississippi law requires only the consent of the parent with primary custody, care, and control of the minor if the parents are divorced or unmarried and living apart and, in all other cases, the consent of only one parent if the other parent is not available in a reasonable time or manner. Miss. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 41-41-53(2) (Supp. 1989). Finally, North Dakota requires only the consent of the custodial parent if the parents are separated and divorced, or the legal guardian if the minor is subject to guardianship. N. D. Cent. Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 14-02.1-03.1 (1981).</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  Subdivision 3 provides, in part:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"For purposes of this section, `parent' means both parents of the pregnant woman if they are both living, one parent of the pregnant woman if only one is living or if the second one cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort, or the guardian or conservator if the pregnant woman has one.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  Subdivision 4 provides:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"No notice shall be required under this section if:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(a) The attending physician certifies in the pregnant woman's medical record that the abortion is necessary to prevent the woman's death and there is insufficient time to provide the required notice; or</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(b) The abortion is authorized in writing by the person or persons who are entitled to notice; or</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(c) The pregnant minor woman declares that she is a victim of sexual abuse, neglect, or physical abuse as defined in section 626.556.

Individuals who are subjects of the investigation have a right of access to the record of the investigation. \\u00c2\\u00a7 626.556(11).</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  Subdivision 5 provides:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Performance of an abortion in violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor and shall be grounds for a civil action by a person wrongfully denied notification. A person shall not be held liable under this section if the person establishes by written evidence that the person relied upon evidence sufficient to convince a careful and prudent person that the representations of the pregnant woman regarding information necessary to comply with this section are bona fide and true, or if the person has attempted with reasonable diligence to deliver notice, but has been unable to do so.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  Subdivision 6 provides:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"If subdivision 2 of this law is ever temporarily or permanently restrained or enjoined by judicial order, subdivision 2 shall be enforced as though the following paragraph were incorporated as paragraph (c) of that subdivision; provided, however, that if such temporary or permanent restraining order or injunction is ever stayed or dissolved, or otherwise ceases to have effect, subdivision 2 shall have full force and effect, without being modified by the addition to the following substitute paragraph which shall have no force or effect until or unless an injunction or restraining order is again in effect.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(c)(i) If such a pregnant woman elects not to allow the notification of one or both of her parents or guardian or conservator, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction shall, upon petition, or motion, and after an appropriate hearing, authorize a physician to perform the abortion if said judge determines that the pregnant women is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion. If said judge determines that the pregnant woman is not mature, or if the pregnant woman does not claim to be mature, the judge shall determine whether the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parents, guardian, or conservator would be in her best interests and shall authorize a physician to perform the abortion without such notification if said judge concludes that the pregnant woman's best interests would be served thereby.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(ii) Such a pregnant woman may participate in proceedings in the court on her own behalf, and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for her.

An order authorizing an abortion without notification shall not be subject to appeal. No filing fees shall be required of any such pregnant woman at either the trial or the appellate level. Access to the trial court for the purposes of such a petition or motion, and access to the appellate courts for purposes of making an appeal from denial of the same, shall be afforded such a pregnant woman 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  Brief for Petitioner in No. 88-1309, p. 4 (hereinafter Minn. Br.); see also <i>id.,</i> at 8-9.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  \\\\\\\"The Minnesota legislature had several purposes in mind when it amended Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343 in 1981. The primary purpose was to protect the well-being of minors by encouraging minors to discuss with their parents the decision whether to terminate their pregnancies. Encouraging such discussion was intended to achieve several salutory results. Parents can provide emotional support and guidance and thus forestall irrational and emotional decision-making. Parents can also provide information concerning the minor's medical history of which the minor may not be aware. Parents can also supervise post-abortion care. In addition, parents can support the minor's psychological well-being and thus mitigate adverse psychological sequelae that may attend the abortion procedure.\\\\\\\" 648 F. Supp. 756, 765-766 (Minn. 1986).</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  The District Court's finding 59 reads as follows:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The court finds that a desire to deter and dissuade minors from choosing to terminate their pregnancies also motivated the legislature. Testimony before a legislative committee considering the proposed notification requirement indicated that influential supporters of the measure hoped it `would save lives' by influencing minors to carry their pregnancies to term rather than aborting.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 766.</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  \\\\\\\"The court also found that a desire to dissuade minors from choosing to terminate their pregnancies also motivated the legislature. Finding 59, Hodgson Appendix 25a. This finding was based on no more than the testimony before a legislative committee of some supporters of the act who hoped it `would save lives.' There is no direct evidence, however, that this was the motive of any legislator.\\\\\\\" Minn. Br. 4, n. 2.</p>\\\\n<p>[14]  On January 23, 1985, the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of defendants on several of the plaintiffs' claims, but reserved ruling on the constitutionality of subdivision 6 as applied until after trial.</p>\\\\n<p>[15]  \\\\\\\"Where the underlying notification provision is unconstitutional because with respect to children of broken families it fails to further the state's significant interests, however, a mature minor or minor whose best interests are contrary to notifying the non-custodial parent is forced to either suffer the unconstitutional requirement or submit to the burdensome court bypass procedure. Such a Hobson's choice fails to further any significant interest. Just as there must be a constitutional judicial alternative to a notice requirement, so there must be a constitutional notice or consent alternative to the court bypass.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The second reason for our conclusion that the court bypass procedure does not save the two-parent notification requirement is that where the parents are divorced, the minor and/or custodial parent, and not a court, is in the best position to determine whether notifying the non-custodial parent would be in the child's best interests. In situations where the minor has a good relationship with the non-custodial parent but the custodial parent does not, there is nothing to prevent the minor from consulting with the non-custodial parent if she so desires. The minor and custodial parent, however, by virtue of their major interest and superior position, should alone have the opportunity to decide to whom, if anyone, notice of the minor's abortion decision should be given.\\\\\\\" App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 88-1125, pp. 68a-69a (citations omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>[16]  The panel did not reach the question of the constitutionality or severability of the mandatory 48-hour waiting period. A concurring judge agreed with the panel that a requirement that a pregnant minor seeking an abortion notify a noncustodial parent could not withstand constitutional scrutiny and was not saved by a court bypass procedure. <i>Id.,</i> at 72a.</p>\\\\n<p>[17]  853 F. 2d, at 1460, quoting from Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622, 640-641 (1979) <i>(Bellotti II)</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[18]  The court also suggested that the statute furthered the \\\\\\\"state interest in providing an opportunity for parents to supply essential medical and other information to a physician,\\\\\\\" 853 F. 2d, at 1461, but the State has not argued here that that interest provides an additional basis for upholding the statute.</p>\\\\n<p>[19]  The court also rejected the argument that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause by singling out abortion as the only pregnancy-related medical procedure requiring notification. <i>Id.,</i> at 1466. The equal protection challenge is not renewed here.</p>\\\\n<p>[20]  See n. 14, <i>supra.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[21]  The District Court found:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"During the period for which statistics have been compiled, 3,573 bypass petitions were filed in Minnesota courts. Six petitions were withdrawn before decision. Nine petitions were denied and 3,558 were granted.\\\\\\\" Finding No. 55, 648 F. Supp., at 765.</p>\\\\n<p>[22]  <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 72-75 (1976); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132 (1976) <i>(Bellotti I)</i><i>; </i><i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (1979); <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U.

S. 476, 490-493 (1983); <i>id.,</i> at 505 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>[23]  The Utah statute reviewed in <i>Matheson</i> required the physician to \\\\\\\"[n]otify, if possible, the parents or guardian of the woman upon whom the abortion is to be performed.\\\\\\\" Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 76-7-304(2) (1990). Unlike the Minnesota statute under review today, the Utah statute did not define the term \\\\\\\"parents.\\\\\\\" The statute is ambiguous as to whether the term refers to each parent individually or rather to the parental unit, which could be represented by either the mother or the father, and neither the argument nor the discussion in <i>Matheson</i> indicated that notice to both parents was required. State law, to the extent it addresses the issue, is to the contrary: Although Utah law provides that a noncustodial parent retains the right to consent to marriage, enlistment, and the performance of major medical or surgical treatment, the right to notice of the minor's abortion is not among the parent's specific residual rights and duties. Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 78-3a-2(13) (Supp. 1989).</p>\\\\n<p>[24]  The figures are not dissimilar to those throughout the Nation. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 12-13 (\\\\\\\"It is estimated that by age 17, 70 percent of white children born in 1980 will have spent at least some time with only one parent, and 94 percent of black children will have lived in one-parent homes\\\\\\\") (citing Hofferth, Updating Children's Life Course, 47 J. Marriage and Fam. 93 (1985)).</p>\\\\n<p>[25]  \\\\\\\"Studies indicating that family violence occurs in two million families in the United States substantially underestimate the actual number of such families. In Minnesota alone, reports indicate that there are an average of 31,200 incidents of assault on women by their partners each year. Based on these statistics, state officials suggest that the `battering' of women by their partners `has come to be recognized as perhaps the most frequently committed violent crime in the state' of Minnesota. These numbers do not include incidents of psychological or sexual abuse, low-level physical abuse, abuse of any sort of the child of a batterer, or those incidents which are not reported. Many minors in Minnesota live in fear of violence by family members; many of them are, in fact, victims of rape, incest, neglect and violence. It is impossible to accurately assess the magnitude of the problem of family violence in Minnesota because members of dysfunctional families are characteristically secretive about such matters and minors are particularly reluctant to reveal violence or abuse in their families. Thus the incidence of such family violence is dramatically underreported.\\\\\\\" 648 F. Supp., at 768-769.</p>\\\\n<p>[26]  \\\\\\\"Minors who are victims of sexual or physical abuse often are reluctant to reveal the existence of the abuse to those outside the home. More importantly, notification to government authorities creates a substantial risk that the confidentiality of the minor's decision to terminate her pregnancy will be lost. Thus, few minors choose to declare they are victims of sexual or physical abuse despite the prevalence of such abuse in Minnesota, as elsewhere.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 764.</p>\\\\n<p>[27]  As one of the guardians ad litem testified: \\\\\\\"We have had situations reported to me by my other gnardians as well as teenagers that I talked to myself who have said that they will consider telling one parent, usually mom, sometimes dad, but since they would have to go to court anyway, because they are absolutely sure they don't want the other parent to know, they don't tell either one.\\\\\\\" App. 239 (Testimony of Susanne Smith).</p>\\\\n<p>[28]  See n. 21, <i>supra.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[29]  One testified that minors found the bypass procedure \\\\\\\"`a very nerveracking experience,\\\\\\\"' Finding 60, 648 F. Supp., at 766; another testified that the minor's \\\\\\\"`level of apprehension is twice what I normally see in court.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> A Massachusetts judge who heard similar petitions in that State expressed the opinion that \\\\\\\"going to court was `absolutely' traumatic for minors . . . `at a very, very difficult time in their lives.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> One judge stated that he did not \\\\\\\"perceive any useful public purpose to what I am doing in these cases\\\\\\\" and that he did not \\\\\\\"see anything that is being accomplished that is useful to anybody.\\\\\\\" Testimony of Gerald C.

Some of them will relax slightly but the majority of them are very nervous\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Doctor Hodgson, one of the plaintiffs in this case, testified that when her minor patients returned from the court process, \\\\\\\"some of them are wringing wet with perspiration. They're markedly relieved, many of them. They \\u00c2\\u2014 they dread the court procedure often more than the actual abortion procedure. And it \\u00c2\\u2014 it's frequently necessary to give them a sedative of some kind beforehand.\\\\\\\" App. 468.</p>\\\\n<p>[30]  According to the testimony at trial, parents who participated in the bypass procedure \\u00c2\\u2014 many of whom had never before been in court \\u00c2\\u2014 were \\\\\\\"real upset\\\\\\\" about having to appear in court, <i>id.,</i> at 167, and were \\\\\\\"angry, they were worried about their kid and they were nervous too.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 186.</p>\\\\n<p>[31]  \\\\\\\"Properly understood . . . the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of individual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter.

Since that clinic typically has a 1- to 2-day backlog, App. 146-147, the statutory waiting period creates little delay.</p>\\\\n<p>[35]  <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S., at 449, upon which the plaintiffs rely, is not to the contrary. There we invalidated a provision that required that mature women, capable of consenting to an abortion, wait 24 hours after giving consent before undergoing an abortion. The only legitimate state interest asserted was that the \\\\\\\"woman's decision be informed.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 450. We decided that \\\\\\\"if a woman, after appropriate counseling, is prepared to give her written informed consent and proceed with the abortion, a State may not demand that she delay the effectuation of that decision.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 450-451. By contrast, in this case, the State asserts a legitimate interest in protecting minor women from their own immaturity. As we explain in the text, the right of the minor to make an informed decision to terminate her pregnancy is not defeated by the 48-hour waiting period. It is significant that the statute does not impose a waiting period if a substitute <i>competent</i> decisionmaker \\u00c2\\u2014 a parent or court \\u00c2\\u2014 gives affirmative consent to the abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>[36]  The most common reason for not notifying the second parent was that that parent was a child- or spouse-batterer, App. 204, and notification would have provoked further abuse. For example, Judge Allen Oleisky, whose familiarity with the Minnesota statute is based on his having heard over 1,000 petitions from minors, <i>id.,</i> at 154, testified that battering is a frequent crime in Minnesota, that parents seek an exemption from the notification requirement because they have been battered or are afraid of assault, and that notification of the father would \\\\\\\"set the whole thing off again in some cases.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 166-167. See also <i>id.,</i> at 237, 245, 339. That testimony is confirmed by the uncontradicted testimony of one of plaintiffs' experts that notice of a daughter's pregnancy \\\\\\\"would absolutely enrage [a batterer]. It would be much like showing a red cape to a bull. That kind of information just plays right into his worst fears and his most vulnerable spots. The sexual jealousy, his dislike of his daughter going out with anybody else, would make him very angry and would probably create severe abuse as well as long term communication difficulties.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 194 (testimony of Lenore Walker).</p>\\\\n<p>[37]  JUSTICE KENNEDY recognizes that parental rights are coupled with parental responsibilities, <i>post,</i> at 483, and that \\\\\\\"a State [may] legislate on the premise that parents, as a general rule, are interested in their children's welfare and will act in accord with it,\\\\\\\" <i>post,</i> at 485. That, of course, is precisely our point. What the State may not do is legislate on the generalized assumptions that a parent in an intact family will not act in his or her child's best interests and will fail to involve the other parent in the child's upbringing when that involvement is appropriate.</p>\\\\n<p>[38]  See, <i>e. g.,</i> Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 6, n. 8 (state law typically allows a minor parent\\u00c2\\u2014whatever her age\\u00c2\\u2014to consent to the health care of her child); Brief for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 25 (\\\\\\\"In areas that do not deal with sexuality or substance abuse, states require, at most, a single parent's consent before performing medical procedures on a minor\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  I concur in Part VII on the understanding that the opinion does not dispute that a minor's liberty interest alone outweighs the interest of the second parent in shaping a child's values and lifestyles, regardless of the interest of the first parent. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 452-453.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  The statute provides for one-parent notification where only one parent is living or where the second parent \\\\\\\"cannot be located through reasonably diligent effort.\\\\\\\" Minn. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 144.343(3) (1988).</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  Dr. Jane Hodgson testified before the District Court that one 14-year-old patient, in order to keep her pregnancy private, tried to induce an abortion with the help of her friends by inserting a metallic object into her vagina, thereby tearing her body, scarring her cervix, and causing bleeding. When that attempt failed to induce an abortion, the patient, then four or five months pregnant, finally went to an abortion clinic. Because of the damage to the patient's cervix, doctors had to perform a hysterotomy, meaning that that woman must have a Cesarean section to deliver a child in the future. App. 462.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  As JUSTICE STEVENS notes, <i>ante,</i> at 449, and n. 35, the 48-hour delay does not apply if a parent or court consents to the abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  Although these other factors would constrain a young woman's ability to schedule an abortion even in the absence of the 48-hour delay requirement, the addition of the immutable statutory delay reduces both the woman's and the clinic's scheduling flexibility and thus can exacerbate the effect of the other factors. For instance, a woman might contact a clinic on Monday and find that her schedule and the clinic's allow for only a Tuesday appointment for that week. Without the 48-hour delay requirement, the woman could be treated the next day; with the statutory delay, however, the woman would be forced to wait a week.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  JUSTICE STEVENS concludes that the 48-hour delay requirement actually results in \\\\\\\"little or no delay\\\\\\\" because the statutory period \\\\\\\"may run concurrently with the time necessary to make an appointment for the procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 449. See also <i>post,</i> at 496 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (\\\\\\\"48-hour waiting period . . . results in little or no delay\\\\\\\"); 853 F. 2d 1452, 1465 (CA8 1988) (en banc). JUSTICE STEVENS bases this conclusion on the testimony of the coadministrator of one abortion clinic that a 1- or 2-day scheduling backlog was typical. <i>Ante,</i> at 449, n. 34. \\\\\\\"One or two days,\\\\\\\" however, obviously means that the backlog is not necessarily 48 hours. Furthermore, that witness also stated that if \\\\\\\"a woman says that she must be seen on a particular day our policy is we will always see her.\\\\\\\" App. 147. But because of the mandated 48-hour delay, the clinic cannot honor a woman's request for an abortion until at least two full days have elapsed. The testimony therefore is hardly sufficient to justify ignoring the District Court's factual finding with regard to the effects of the delay requirement.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  The State also asserts that the requirements permit parents to provide doctors with relevant information about their daughters' medical history and \\\\\\\"to assist with ensuring that proper after-care procedures are followed.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 88-1309, pp. 34-36. See also <i>ante,</i> at 448 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (delay period \\\\\\\"permits the parent to inquire into the competency of the doctor performing the abortion\\\\\\\"). If these are actual state interests, it seems peculiar that the State does not try to facilitate similar parental involvement in minors' treatment for pregnancy and childbirth, see <i>infra</i> this page, which pose far greater risks to the minor's health than abortion, see <i>supra,</i> at 466-467. In any event, compelled notification is unlikely to result in helpful parental involvement in those families in which a parent reacts to the news of the daughter's predicament by rejecting or abusing the young woman. See <i>supra</i> this page.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  Dr. Hodgson testified that some minors dread the court procedure so much that they become \\\\\\\"wringing wet with perspiration\\\\\\\" and frequently require a sedative beforehand. App. 468. One judge who has heard a significant number of bypass petitions testified that the court experience is \\\\\\\"`very nervewracking'\\\\\\\" for young women. 648 F. Supp., at 766. Another testified that pregnant minors' \\\\\\\"`level of apprehension is twice what I normally see in court. . . . You see all the typical things that you would see with somebody under incredible amounts of stress, answering mono-syllabically, tone of voice, tenor of voice, shaky, wringing of hands, you know, one young lady had her \\u00c2\\u2014 her hands were turning blue and it was warm in my office.'\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[9]  Maine, for example, requires that a minor obtain the consent of a parent, guardian, or adult family member; undergo a judicial bypass; or receive counseling from the physician or a counselor according to specified criteria. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 22, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1597-A (Supp. 1989). Wisconsin requires abortion providers to encourage parental notification unless they determine that the minor has a valid reason for not notifying her parents. Wis. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 146.78 (1987-1988). In the latter situation, the provider must encourage\\u00c2\\u2014but not require\\u00c2\\u2014the minor to notify \\\\\\\"another family member, close family friend, school counselor, social worker or other appropriate person.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 146.78(5)(c). I express no opinion on the constitutionality or efficacy of these schemes, but raise them only as examples of alternatives that seem more closely related than a judicial bypass procedure to the goal of ensuring that the minor's decision is informed.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>In any event, most abortion clinics already provide extensive counseling. See 1 National Research Council, Risking the Future: Adolescent Sexuality, Pregnancy, and Childbearing 191-192 (C. Hayes ed. 1987) (90% of abortion clinics routinely provide counseling for all first-abortion patients, and all clinics make counseling available to all patients on request).</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  Indeed, the State conceded in oral argument before the Eighth Circuit, sitting en banc, that a judicial approval provision by itself would be unconstitutional.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe, ante,</i> p. 438, we hold today that Title XIX of the Social Security Act does not require the funding of nontherapeutic abortions as a condition of participation in the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*466</span> joint federal-state Medicaid program established by that statute. In this case, as a result of our decision in <i>Beal,</i> we must decide whether the Constitution requires a participating State to pay for nontherapeutic abortions when it pays for childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>A regulation of the Connecticut Welfare Department limits state Medicaid benefits for first trimester abortions<sup>[1]</sup> to those that are \\\\\\\"medically necessary,\\\\\\\" a term defined to include psychiatric necessity. Connecticut Welfare Department, Public Assistance Program Manual, Vol. 3, c. III, \\u00c2\\u00a7 275 (1975).<sup>[2]</sup> Connecticut enforces this limitation through a system of prior authorization from its Department of Social Services. In order to obtain authorization for a first trimester abortion, the hospital or clinic where the abortion is to be performed must submit, among other things, a certificate from the patient's attending physician stating that the abortion is medically necessary.</p>\\\\n<p>This attack on the validity of the Connecticut regulation <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*467</span> was brought against appellant Maher, the Commisioner of Social Services, by appellees Poe and Roe, two indigent women who were unable to obtain a physician's certificate of medical necessity.<sup>[3]</sup> In a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, they challenged the regulation both as inconsistent with the requirements of Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as added, 79 Stat. 343, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1396 <i>et seq.</i> (1970 ed. and Supp. V), and as violative of their constitutional rights, including the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees of due process and equal protection. Connecticut originally defended its regulation on the theory that Title XIX of the Social Security Act prohibited the funding of abortions that were not medically necessary. After certifying a class of women unable to obtain Medicaid assistance for abortions because of the regulation, the District Court held that the Social Security Act not only allowed state funding of nontherapeutic abortions but also required it. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Norton,</i> 380 F. Supp. 726 (1974). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit read the Social Security Act to allow, but not to require, state funding of such abortions. 522 F. 2d 928 (1975). Upon remand for consideration of the constitutional issues raised in the complaint, a three-judge District Court was convened. That court invalidated the Connecticut regulation. 408 F. Supp. 660 (1975).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*468</span> Although it found no independent constitutional right to a state-financed abortion, the District Court held that the Equal Protection Clause forbids the exclusion of nontherapeutic abortions from a state welfare program that generally subsidizes the medical expenses incident to pregnancy and childbirth. The court found implicit in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973), the view that \\\\\\\"abortion and childbirth, when stripped of the sensitive moral arguments surrounding the abortion controversy, are simply two alternative medical methods of dealing with pregnancy. . . .\\\\\\\" 408 F. Supp., at 663 n. 3. Relying also on <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 394 U. S. 618 (1969), and <i>Memorial Hospital</i> v. <i>Maricopa County,</i> 415 U. S. 250 (1974), the court held that the Connecticut program \\\\\\\"weights the choice of the pregnant mother against choosing to exercise her constitutionally protected right\\\\\\\" to a nontherapeutic abortion and \\\\\\\"thus infringes upon a fundamental interest.\\\\\\\" 408 F. Supp., at 663-664. The court found no state interest to justify this infringement. The State's fiscal interest was held to be \\\\\\\"wholly chimerical because abortion is the least expensive medical response to a pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 664 (footnote omitted). And any moral objection to abortion was deemed constitutionally irrelevant:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The state may not justify its refusal to pay for one type of expense arising from pregnancy on the basis that it morally opposes such an expenditure of money. To sanction such a justification would be to permit discrimination against those seeking to exercise a constitutional right on the basis that the state simply does not approve of the exercise of that right.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>\\\\n</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court enjoined the State from requiring the certificate of medical necessity for Medicaid-funded abortions.<sup>[4]</sup><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*469</span> The court also struck down the related requirements of prior written request by the pregnant woman and prior authorization by the Department of Social Services, holding that the State could not impose any requirements on Medicaid payments for abortions that are not \\\\\\\"equally applicable to medicaid payments for childbirth, if such conditions or requirements tend to discourage a woman from choosing an abortion or to delay the occurrence of an abortion that she has asked her physician to perform.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 665. We noted probable jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the Connecticut regulation. 428 U. S. 908 (1976).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The Constitution imposes no obligation on the States to pay the pregnancy-related medical expenses of indigent women, or indeed to pay any of the medical expenses of indigents.<sup>[5]</sup> But when a State decides to alleviate some of the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*470</span> hardships of poverty by providing medical care, the manner in which it dispenses benefits is subject to constitutional limitations. Appellees' claim is that Connecticut must accord equal treatment to both abortion and childbirth, and may not evidence a policy preference by funding only the medical expenses incident to childbirth. This challenge to the classifications established by the Connecticut regulation presents a question arising under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The basic framework of analysis of such a claim is well settled:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"We must decide, first, whether [state legislation] operates to the disadvantage of some suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution, thereby requiring strict judicial scrutiny. . . . If not, the [legislative] scheme must still be examined to determine whether it rationally furthers some legitimate, articulated state purpose and therefore does not constitute an invidious discrimination. . . .\\\\\\\" <i>San Antonio School Dist.</i> v. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 411 U. S. 1, 17 (1973).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Accord, <i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement</i> v. <i>Murgia,</i> 427 U. S. 307, 312, 314 (1976). Applying this analysis here, we think the District Court erred in holding that the Connecticut regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>This case involves no discrimination against a suspect class. An indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*471</span> the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases. Nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who cannot pay lead to a different conclusion. In a sense, every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or services. But this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. See <i>Rodriguez, supra,</i> at 29; <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 397 U. S. 471 (1970).<sup>[6]</sup> Accordingly, the central question in this case is whether the regulation \\\\\\\"impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution.\\\\\\\" The District Court read our decisions in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and the subsequent cases applying it, as establishing a fundamental right to abortion and therefore concluded that nothing less than a compelling state interest would justify Connecticut's different treatment of abortion and childbirth. We think the District Court misconceived the nature and scope of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>At issue in <i>Roe</i> was the constitutionality of a Texas law making it a crime to procure or attempt to procure an abortion, except on medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother. Drawing on a group of disparate cases restricting governmental intrusion, physical coercion, and criminal prohibition of certain activities, we concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*472</span> affords constitutional protection against state interference with certain aspects of an individual's personal \\\\\\\"privacy,\\\\\\\" including a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.<sup>[7]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 153.</p>\\\\n<p>The Texas statute imposed severe criminal sanctions on the physicians and other medical personnel who performed abortions, thus drastically limiting the availability and safety of the desired service. As MR. JUSTICE STEWART observed, \\\\\\\"it is difficult to imagine a more complete abridgment of a constitutional freedom . . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 170 (concurring opinion). We held that only a compelling state interest would justify such a sweeping restriction on a constitutionally protected interest, and we found no such state interest during the first trimester. Even when judged against this demanding standard, however, the State's dual interest in the health of the pregnant woman and the potential life of the fetus were deemed sufficient to justify substantial regulation of abortions in the second and third trimesters. \\\\\\\"These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes `compelling.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 162-163. In the second trimester, the State's interest in the health of the pregnant woman justifies state regulation reasonably related to that concern. <i>Id.,</i> at 163. At viability, usually in the third trimester, the State's interest in the potential life of the fetus justifies prohibition with criminal penalties, except where the life or health of the mother is threatened. <i>Id.,</i> at 163-164.</p>\\\\n<p>The Texas law in <i>Roe</i> was a stark example of impermissible interference with the pregnant woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy. In subsequent cases, we have invalidated <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*473</span> other types of restrictions, different in form but similar in effect, on the woman's freedom of choice. Thus, in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 70-71, n. 11 (1976), we held that Missouri's requirement of spousal consent was unconstitutional because it \\\\\\\"granted [the husband] the right to prevent unilaterally, and for whatever reason, the effectuation of his wife's and her physician's decision to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" Missouri had interposed an \\\\\\\"<i>absolute obstacle</i> to a woman's decision that <i>Roe</i> held to be constitutionally protected from such interference.\\\\\\\" (Emphasis added.) Although a state-created obstacle need not be absolute to be impermissible, see <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973); <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977), we have held that a requirement for a lawful abortion \\\\\\\"is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976). We recognized in <i>Bellotti</i> that \\\\\\\"not all distinction between abortion and other procedures is forbidden\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"[t]he constitutionality of such distinction will depend upon its degree and the justification for it.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 149-150. We therefore declined to rule on the constitutionality of a Massachusetts statute regulating a minor's access to an abortion until the state courts had had an opportunity to determine whether the statute authorized a parental veto over the minor's decision or the less burdensome requirement of parental consultation.</p>\\\\n<p>These cases recognize a constitutionally protected interest \\\\\\\"in making certain kinds of important decisions\\\\\\\" free from governmental compulsion. <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 599-600, and nn. 24 and 26 (1977). As <i>Whalen</i> makes clear, the right in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> can be understood only by considering both the woman's interest and the nature of the State's interference with it. <i>Roe</i> did not declare an unqualified \\\\\\\"constitutional right to an abortion,\\\\\\\" as the District Court seemed to think. Rather, the right protects the woman from <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*474</span> unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. It implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion, and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.</p>\\\\n<p>The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles\\u00c2\\u2014absolute or otherwise\\u00c2\\u2014in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficult\\u00c2\\u2014and in some cases, perhaps, impossible\\u00c2\\u2014for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation. We conclude that the Connecticut regulation does not impinge upon the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe.</i><sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*475</span> C</h2>\\\\n<p>Our conclusion signals no retreat from <i>Roe</i> or the cases applying it. There is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*476</span> Constitutional concerns are greatest when the State attempts to impose its will by force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader.</p>\\\\n<p>This distinction is implicit in two cases cited in <i>Roe</i> in support of the pregnant woman's right under the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S. 390 (1923), involved a Nebraska law making it criminal to teach foreign languages to children who had not passed the eighth grade. <i>Id.,</i> at 396-397. Nebraska's imposition of a criminal sanction on the providers of desired services makes <i>Meyer</i> closely analogous to <i>Roe.</i> In sustaining the constitutional challenge brought by a teacher convicted under the law, the Court held that the teacher's \\\\\\\"right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children\\\\\\\" were \\\\\\\"within the liberty of the Amendment.\\\\\\\" 262 U. S., at 400. In <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510 (1925), the Court relied on <i>Meyer</i> to invalidate an Oregon criminal law requiring the parent or guardian of a child to send him to a public school, thus precluding the choice of a private school. Reasoning that the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of liberty \\\\\\\"excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only,\\\\\\\" the Court held that the law \\\\\\\"unreasonably interfere[d] with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control.\\\\\\\" 268 U. S., at 534-535.</p>\\\\n<p>Both cases invalidated substantial restrictions on constitutionally protected liberty interests: in <i>Meyer,</i> the parent's right to have his child taught a particular foreign language; in <i>Pierce,</i> the parent's right to choose private rather than public school education. But neither case denied to a State <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*477</span> the policy choice of encouraging the preferred course of action. Indeed, in <i>Meyer</i> the Court was careful to state that the power of the State \\\\\\\"to prescribe a curriculum\\\\\\\" that included English and excluded German in its free public schools \\\\\\\"is not questioned.\\\\\\\" 262 U. S., at 402. Similarly, <i>Pierce</i> casts no shadow over a State's power to favor public education by funding it\\u00c2\\u2014a policy choice pursued in some States for more than a century. See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483, 489 n. 4 (1954). Indeed, in <i>Norwood</i> v. <i>Harrison,</i> 413 U. S. 455, 462 (1973), we explicitly rejected the argument that <i>Pierce</i> established a \\\\\\\"right of private or parochial schools to share with public schools in state largesse,\\\\\\\" noting that \\\\\\\"[i]t is one thing to say that a State may not prohibit the maintenance of private schools and quite another to say that such schools must, as a matter of equal protection, receive state aid.\\\\\\\" Yet, were we to accept appellees' argument, an indigent parent could challenge the state policy of favoring public rather than private schools, or of preferring instruction in English rather than German, on grounds identical in principle to those advanced here. We think it abundantly clear that a State is not required to show a compelling interest for its policy choice to favor normal childbirth any more than a State must so justify its election to fund public but not private education.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*478</span> D</h2>\\\\n<p>The question remains whether Connecticut's regulation can be sustained under the less demanding test of rationality that applies in the absence of a suspect classification or the impingement of a fundamental right. This test requires that the distinction drawn between childbirth and nontherapeutic abortion by the regulation be \\\\\\\"rationally related\\\\\\\" to a \\\\\\\"constitutionally permissible\\\\\\\" purpose. <i>Lindsey</i> v. <i>Normet,</i> 405 U. S. 56, 74 (1972); <i>Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement</i> v. <i>Murgia,</i> 427 U. S., at 314. We hold that the Connecticut funding scheme satisfies this standard.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> itself explicitly acknowledged the State's strong interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus. That interest exists throughout the pregnancy, \\\\\\\"grow[ing] in substantiality as the woman approaches term.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 162-163. Because the pregnant woman carries a potential human being, she \\\\\\\"cannot be isolated in her privacy. . . . [Her] privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 159. The State unquestionably has a \\\\\\\"strong and legitimate interest in encouraging normal childbirth,\\\\\\\" <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe, ante,</i> at 446, an interest honored over the centuries.<sup>[11]</sup> Nor can there be any question that the Connecticut regulation rationally furthers that interest. The medical costs associated with childbirth are substantial, and have increased significantly in recent years. As <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*479</span> recognized by the District Court in this case, such costs are significantly greater than those normally associated with elective abortions during the first trimester. The subsidizing of costs incident to childbirth is a rational means of encouraging childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>We certainly are not unsympathetic to the plight of an indigent woman who desires an abortion, but \\\\\\\"the Constitution does not provide judicial remedies for every social and economic ill,\\\\\\\" <i>Lindsey</i> v. <i>Normet, supra,</i> at 74. Our cases uniformly have accorded the States a wider latitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds.<sup>[12]</sup> In <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 397 U. S., at 485, despite recognition that laws and regulations allocating welfare funds involve \\\\\\\"the most basic economic needs of impoverished human beings,\\\\\\\" we held that classifications survive equal protection challenge when a \\\\\\\"reasonable basis\\\\\\\" for the classification is shown. As the preceding discussion makes clear, the state interest in encouraging normal childbirth exceeds this minimal level.</p>\\\\n<p>The decision whether to expend state funds for nontherapeutic abortion is fraught with judgments of policy and value over which opinions are sharply divided. Our conclusion that the Connecticut regulation is constitutional is not based on a weighing of its wisdom or social desirability, for this Court does not strike down state laws \\\\\\\"because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\\\\\\\" <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U. S. 483, 488 (1955), quoted in <i>Dandridge</i> v. <i>Williams, supra,</i> at 484. Indeed, when an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated by public funding of nontherapeutic abortions, the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature. We should not forget that \\\\\\\"legislatures <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*480</span> are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\\\\\\\" <i>Missouri, K. &amp; T. R. Co.</i> v. <i>May,</i> 194 U. S. 267, 270 (1904) (Holmes, J.).<sup>[13]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In conclusion, we emphasize that our decision today does not proscribe government funding of nontherapeutic abortions. It is open to Congress to require provision of Medicaid benefits for such abortions as a condition of state participation in the Medicaid program. Also, under Title XIX as construed in <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe, ante,</i> p. 438, Connecticut is free\\u00c2\\u2014through normal democratic processes\\u00c2\\u2014to decide that such benefits should be provided. We hold only that the Constitution does not require a judicially imposed resolution of these difficult issues.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The District Court also invalidated Connecticut's requirements of prior written request by the pregnant woman and prior authorization by the Department of Social Services. Our analysis above rejects the basic premise that prompted invalidation of these procedural requirements. It is not unreasonable for a State to insist upon a prior showing of medical necessity to insure that its money is being spent only for authorized purposes. The simple answer to the argument that similar requirements are not imposed for other medical procedures is that such procedures do not involve the termination of a potential human life. In <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), we held that the woman's written consent to an abortion was not an impermissible burden under <i>Roe.</i> We think that decision is controlling on the similar issue here.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*481</span> The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, see <i>ante,</i> p. 454.]</p>\\\\n<p>[For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, see <i>ante,</i> p. 462.]</p>\\\\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>I join the Court's opinion. Like the Court, I do not read any decision of this Court as requiring a State to finance a nontherapeutic abortion. The Court's holdings in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973), simply require that a State not create an absolute barrier to a woman's decision to have an abortion. These precedents do not suggest that the State is constitutionally required to assist her in procuring it.</p>\\\\n<p>From time to time, every state legislature determines that, as a matter of sound public policy, the government ought to provide certain health and social services to its citizens. Encouragement of childbirth and child care is not a novel undertaking in this regard. Various governments, both in this country and in others, have made such a determination for centuries. In recent times, they have similarly provided educational services. The decision to provide any one of these services\\u00c2\\u2014or not to provide them\\u00c2\\u2014is not required by the Federal Constitution. Nor does the providing of a particular service require, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the provision of another.</p>\\\\n<p>Here, the State of Connecticut has determined that it will finance certain childbirth expenses. That legislative determination <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*482</span> places no state-created barrier to a woman's choice to procure an abortion, and it does not require the State to provide it. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court held:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"When Connecticut refuses to fund elective abortions while funding therapeutic abortions and prenatal and postnatal care, it weights the choice of the pregnant mother against choosing to exercise her constitutionally protected right to an elective abortion. . . . Her choice is affected not simply by the absence of payment for the abortion, but by the availability of public funds for childbirth if she chooses not to have the abortion. When the state thus infringes upon a fundamental interest, it must assert a compelling state interest.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Norton,</i> 408 F. Supp. 660, 663-664 (1975).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>This Court reverses on the ground that \\\\\\\"the District Court misconceived the nature and scope of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe</i> [v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973)],\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 471, and therefore that Connecticut was not required to meet the \\\\\\\"compelling interest\\\\\\\" test to justify its discrimination against elective abortion but only \\\\\\\"the less demanding test of rationality that applies in the absence of . . . the impingement of a fundamental right,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 477, 478. This holding, the Court insists, \\\\\\\"places no obstacles\\u00c2\\u2014absolute or otherwise\\u00c2\\u2014 in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion\\\\\\\"; she is still at liberty to finance the abortion from \\\\\\\"private sources.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 474. True, \\\\\\\"the State may [by funding childbirth] have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> True, also, indigency \\\\\\\"may make it difficult\\u00c2\\u2014and in some cases, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*483</span> perhaps impossible\\u00c2\\u2014for some women to have abortions,\\\\\\\" but that regrettable consequence \\\\\\\"is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>But a distressing insensitivity to the plight of impoverished pregnant women is inherent in the Court's analysis. The stark reality for too many, not just \\\\\\\"some,\\\\\\\" indigent pregnant women is that indigency makes access to competent licensed physicians not merely \\\\\\\"difficult\\\\\\\" but \\\\\\\"impossible.\\\\\\\" As a practical matter, many indigent women will feel they have no choice but to carry their pregnancies to term because the State will pay for the associated medical services, even though they would have chosen to have abortions if the State had also provided funds for that procedure, or indeed if the State had provided funds for neither procedure. This disparity in funding by the State clearly operates to coerce indigent pregnant women to bear children they would not otherwise choose to have, and just as clearly, this coercion can only operate upon the poor, who are uniquely the victims of this form of financial pressure. Mr. Justice Frankfurter's words are apt:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"To sanction such a ruthless consequence, inevitably resulting from a money hurdle erected by the State, would justify a latter-day Anatole France to add one more item to his ironic comments on the `majestic equality' of the law. \\\\\\\"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread'. . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 351 U. S. 12, 23 (1956) (concurring opinion).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>None can take seriously the Court's assurance that its \\\\\\\"conclusion signals no retreat from <i>Roe</i> [v. <i>Wade</i>] or the cases applying it,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 475. That statement must occasion great surprise among the Courts of Appeals and District Courts that, relying upon <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973), have held that States are constitutionally required to fund elective abortions if they fund pregnancies carried to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*484</span> term. See <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Rose,</i> 499 F. 2d 1112 (CA10 1974); <i>Wulff</i> v. <i>Singleton,</i> 508 F. 2d 1211 (CA8 1974), rev'd and remanded on other grounds, 428 U. S. 106 (1976); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Westby,</i> 383 F. Supp. 1143 (WDSD 1974), vacated and remanded (in light of <i>Hagans</i> v. <i>Lavine,</i> 415 U. S. 528 (1974)), 420 U. S. 968, on remand, 402 F. Supp. 140 (1975); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Wohlgemuth,</i> 376 F. Supp. 173 (WD Pa. 1974), aff'd on statutory grounds <i>sub nom. </i><i>Doe</i> v. <i>Beal,</i> 523 F. 2d 611 (CA3 1975), rev'd and remanded, <i>ante,</i> p. 438; <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Rampton,</i> 366 F. Supp. 189 (Utah 1973); <i>Klein</i> v. <i>Nassau County Medical Center,</i> 347 F. Supp. 496 (EDNY 1972), vacated and remanded (in light of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 412 U. S. 925 (1973)), on remand, 409 F. Supp. 731 (1976). Indeed, it cannot be gainsaid that today's decision seriously erodes the principles that <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe</i> announced to guide the determination of what constitutes an unconstitutional infringement of the fundamental right of pregnant women to be free to decide whether to have an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's premise is that only an equal protection claim is presented here. Claims of interference with enjoyment of fundamental rights have, however, occupied a rather protean position in our constitutional jurisprudence. Whether or not the Court's analysis may reasonably proceed under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court plainly errs in ignoring, as it does, the unanswerable argument of appellees, and the holding of the District Court, that the regulation unconstitutionally impinges upon their claim of privacy derived from the Due Process Clause.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and cases following it hold that an area of privacy invulnerable to the State's intrusion surrounds the decision of a pregnant woman whether or not to carry her pregnancy to term. The Connecticut scheme clearly impinges upon that area of privacy by bringing financial pressures on indigent women that force them to bear children they would not otherwise have. That is an obvious impairment of the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*485</span> fundamental right established by <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> Yet the Court concludes that \\\\\\\"the Connecticut regulation does not impinge upon [that] fundamental right.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 474. This conclusion is based on a perceived distinction, on the one hand, between the imposition of criminal penalties for the procurement of an abortion present in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i> and the absolute prohibition present in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), and, on the other, the assertedly lesser inhibition imposed by the Connecticut scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 472-474.</p>\\\\n<p>The last time our Brother POWELL espoused the concept in an abortion case that \\\\\\\"[t]here is a basic difference between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 475, the Court refused to adopt it. <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff,</i> 428 U. S. 106, 122 (1976). This was made explicit in Part II of our Brother BLACKMUN'S opinion for four of us and is implicit in our Brother STEVENS' essential agreement with the analysis of Part II-B. <i>Id.,</i> at 121-122 (concurring in part). Part II-B stated:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"MR. JUSTICE POWELL would so limit <i>Doe</i> and the other cases cited, explaining them as cases in which the State `directly interfered with the abortion decision' and `directly interdicted the normal functioning of the physician-patient relationship by criminalizing certain procedures,' [428 U. S.,] at 128. There is no support in the language of the cited cases for this distinction . . . . Moreover, a `direct interference' or `interdiction' test does not appear to be supported by precedent. . . . For a doctor who cannot afford to work for nothing, and a woman who cannot afford to pay him, the State's refusal to fund an abortion is as effective an `interdiction' of it as would ever be necessary. Furthermore, since the right . . . is not simply the right to have an abortion, but the right to have abortions nondiscriminatorily funded, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*486</span> the denial of such funding is as complete an `interdiction' of the exercise of the right as could ever exist.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 118 n. 7.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>We have also rejected this approach in other abortion cases. <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i><i>,</i> the companion to <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> in addition to striking down the Georgia criminal prohibition against elective abortions, struck down the procedural requirements of certification of hospitals, of approval by a hospital committee, and of concurrence in the abortion decision by two doctors other than the woman's own doctor. None of these requirements operated as an absolute bar to elective abortions in the manner of the criminal prohibitions present in the other aspect of the case or in <i>Roe,</i> but this was not sufficient to save them from unconstitutionality. In <i>Planned Parenthood, supra,</i> we struck down a requirement for spousal consent to an elective abortion which the Court characterizes today simply as an \\\\\\\"absolute obstacle\\\\\\\" to a woman's obtaining an abortion. <i>Ante,</i> at 473. But the obstacle was \\\\\\\"absolute\\\\\\\" only in the limited sense that a woman who was unable to persuade her spouse to agree to an elective abortion was prevented from obtaining one. Any woman whose husband agreed, or could be persuaded to agree, was free to obtain an abortion, and the State never imposed directly any prohibition of its own. This requirement was qualitatively different from the criminal statutes that the Court today says are comparable, but we nevertheless found it unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>Most recently, also in a privacy case, the Court squarely reaffirmed that the right of privacy was fundamental, and that an infringement upon that right must be justified by a compelling state interest. <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977). That case struck down in its entirety a New York law forbidding the sale of contraceptives to minors under 16 years old, limiting persons who could sell contraceptives to pharmacists, and forbidding advertisement <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*487</span> and display of contraceptives. There was no New York law forbidding <i>use</i> of contraceptives by anyone, including minors under 16, and therefore no \\\\\\\"absolute\\\\\\\" prohibition against the exercise of the fundamental right. Nevertheless the statute was declared unconstitutional as a burden on the right to privacy. In words that apply fully to Connecticut's statute, and that could hardly be more explicit, <i>Carey</i> stated: \\\\\\\"`Compelling' is of course the key word; where a decision as fundamental as that whether to bear or beget a child is involved, regulations imposing a burden on it may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be narrowly drawn to express only those interests.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 686. <i>Carey</i> relied specifically upon <i>Roe, Doe,</i> and <i>Planned Parenthood,</i> and interpreted them in a way flatly inconsistent with the Court's interpretation today: \\\\\\\"The significance of these cases is that they establish that the same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual's right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely.\\\\\\\" 431 U. S., at 688.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, cases involving other fundamental rights also make clear that the Court's concept of what constitutes an impermissible infringement upon the fundamental right of a pregnant woman to choose to have an abortion makes new law. We have repeatedly found that infringements of fundamental rights are not limited to outright denials of those rights. First Amendment decisions have consistently held in a wide variety of contexts that the compelling-state-interest test is applicable not only to outright denials but also to restraints that make exercise of those rights more difficult. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U. S. 398 (1963) (free exercise of religion); <i>NAACP</i> v. <i>Button,</i> 371 U. S. 415 (1963) (freedom of expression and association), <i>Linmark Associates</i> v. <i>Township of Willingboro,</i> 431 U. S. 85 (1977) (freedom of expression). <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*488</span> The compelling-state-interest test has been applied in voting cases, even where only relatively small infringements upon voting power, such as dilution of voting strength caused by malapportionment, have been involved. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Reynolds</i> v. <i>Sims,</i> 377 U. S. 533, 562, 566 (1964); <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>Meier,</i> 420 U. S. 1 (1975); <i>Connor</i> v. <i>Finch,</i> 431 U. S. 407 (1977). Similarly, cases involving the right to travel have consistently held that statutes penalizing the fundamental right to travel must pass muster under the compelling-state-interest test, irrespective of whether the statutes actually deter travel. <i>Memorial Hospital</i> v. <i>Maricopa County,</i> 415 U. S. 250, 257-258 (1974); <i>Dunn</i> v. <i>Blumstein,</i> 405 U. S. 330, 339-341 (1972); <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 394 U. S. 618 (1969). And indigents asserting a fundamental right of access to the courts have been excused payment of entry costs without being required first to show that their indigency was an absolute bar to access. <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 351 U. S. 12 (1956); <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>California,</i> 372 U. S. 353 (1963); <i>Boddie</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 401 U. S. 371 (1971).</p>\\\\n<p>Until today, I had not thought the nature of the fundamental right established in <i>Roe</i> was open to question, let alone susceptible of the interpretation advanced by the Court. The fact that the Connecticut scheme may not operate as an absolute bar preventing all indigent women from having abortions is not critical. What is critical is that the State has inhibited their fundamental right to make that choice free from state interference.</p>\\\\n<p>Nor does the manner in which Connecticut has burdened the right freely to choose to have an abortion save its Medicaid program. The Connecticut scheme cannot be distinguished from other grants and withholdings of financial benefits that we have held unconstitutionally burdened a fundamental right. <i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner, supra</i><i>,</i> struck down a South Carolina statute that denied unemployment compensation to a woman who for religious reasons could not <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*489</span> work on Saturday, but that would have provided such compensation if her unemployment had stemmed from a number of other nonreligious causes. Even though there was no proof of indigency in that case, <i>Sherbert</i> held that \\\\\\\"the pressure upon her to forgo [her religious] practice [was] unmistakable,\\\\\\\" 374 U. S., at 404, and therefore held that the effect was the same as a fine imposed for Saturday worship. Here, though the burden is upon the right to privacy derived from the Due Process Clause and not upon freedom of religion under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the governing principle is the same, for Connecticut grants and withholds financial benefits in a manner that discourages significantly the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right. Indeed, the case for application of the principle actually is stronger than in <i>Verner</i> since appellees are all indigents and therefore even more vulnerable to the financial pressures imposed by the Connecticut regulation.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976), held, and the Court today agrees, <i>ante,</i> at 473, that a state requirement is unconstitutional if it \\\\\\\"unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion.\\\\\\\" Connecticut has \\\\\\\"unduly\\\\\\\" burdened the fundamental right of pregnant women to be free to choose to have an abortion because the State has advanced no compelling state interest to justify its interference in that choice.</p>\\\\n<p>Although appellant does not argue it as justification, the Court concludes that the State's interest \\\\\\\"in protecting the potential life of the fetus\\\\\\\" suffices, <i>ante,</i> at 478.<sup>[*]</sup> Since only the first trimester of pregnancy is involved in this case, that justification is totally foreclosed if the Court is not overruling <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*490</span> the holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> that \\\\\\\"[w]ith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the `compelling' point is at viability,\\\\\\\" occurring at about the end of the second trimester. 410 U. S., at 163. The appellant also argues a further justification not relied upon by the Court, namely, that the State needs \\\\\\\"to control the amount of its limited public funds which will be allocated to its public welfare budget.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellant 22. The District Court correctly held, however, that the asserted interest was \\\\\\\"wholly chimerical\\\\\\\" because the \\\\\\\"state's assertion that it saves money when it declines to pay the cost of a welfare mother's abortion is simply contrary to undisputed facts.\\\\\\\" 408 F. Supp., at 664.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, the reasons that render the Connecticut regulation unconstitutional also render invalid, in my view, the requirement of a prior written certification by the woman's attending physician that the abortion is \\\\\\\"medically necessary,\\\\\\\" and the requirement that the hospital submit a Request for Authorization of Professional Services including a \\\\\\\"statement indicating the medical need for the abortion.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellees 2-3. For the same reasons, I would also strike down the requirement for prior authorization of payment by the Connecticut Department of Social Services.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]  <i>William F.

Conley,</i> Deputy Attorney General, filed a brief for the State of New Jersey as <i>amicus curiae</i> urging reversal.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p><i>Sylvia A. Law, Harriet F. Pilpel,</i> and <i>Eve W. Paul</i> filed a brief for the American Public Health Assn. et al. as <i>amici curiae</i> urging affirmance.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Patricia A. Butler</i> and <i>Michael A. Wolff</i> filed a brief for Jane Doe as <i>amicus curiae.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[1]  The procedures governing abortions beyond the first trimester are not challenged here.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  Section 275 provides in relevant part:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The Department makes payment for abortion services under the Medical Assistance (Title XIX) Program when the following conditions are met:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"1. In the opinion of the attending physician the abortion is medically necessary. The term `Medically Necessary' includes psychiatric necessity.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"2. The abortion is to be performed in an accredited hospital or licensed clinic when the patient is in the first trimester of pregnancy. . . .</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"3. The written request for the abortion is submitted by the patient, and in the case of a minor, from the parent or guardian.</p>\\\\n<p>.....</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"4. Prior authorization for the abortion is secured from the Chief of Medical Services, Division of Health Services, Department of Social Services.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>See n. 4, <i>infra.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[3]  At the time this action was filed, Mary Poe, a 16-year-old high school junior, had already obtained an abortion at a Connecticut hospital. Apparently because of Poe's inability to obtain a certificate of medical necessity, the hospital was denied reimbursement by the Department of Social Services. As a result, Poe was being pressed to pay the hospital bill of $244. Susan Roe, an unwed mother of three children, was unable to obtain an abortion because of her physician's refusal to certify that the procedure was medically necessary. By consent, a temporary restraining order was entered by the District Court enjoining the Connecticut officials from refusing to pay for Roe's abortion. After the remand from the Court of Appeals, the District Court issued temporary restraining orders covering three additional women. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Norton,</i> 408 F. Supp. 660, 663 (1975).</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  The District Court's judgment and order, entered on January 16, 1976, were not stayed. On January 26, 1976, the Department of Social Services revised \\u00c2\\u00a7 275 to allow reimbursement for nontherapeutic abortions without prior authorization or consent. The fact that this revision was made retroactive to January 16, 1976, suggests that the revision was made only for the purpose of interim compliance with the District Court's judgment and order, which were entered the same date. No suggestion of mootness has been made by any of the parties, and this appeal was taken and submitted on the theory that Connecticut desires to reinstate the invalidated regulation. Under these circumstances, the subsequent revision of the regulation does not render the case moot. In any event, there would remain the denial of reimbursement to Mary Poe, and similarly situated members of the class, under the prerevision regulation. See 380 F. Supp., at 730 n. 3. The State has asserted no Eleventh Amendment defense to this relief sought by Poe and those whom she represents.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  <i>Boddie</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 401 U. S. 371 (1971), cited by appellees, is not to the contrary. There the Court invalidated under the Due Process Clause \\\\\\\"certain state procedures for the commencement of litigation, including requirements for payment of court fees and costs for service of process,\\\\\\\" restricting the ability of indigent persons to bring an action for divorce. <i>Id.,</i> at 372. The Court held:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"[G]iven the basic position of the marriage relationship in this society's hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process does prohibit a State from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who seek judicial dissolution of their marriages.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 374. Because Connecticut has made no attempt to monopolize the means for terminating pregnancies through abortion the present case is easily distinguished from <i>Boddie.</i> See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kras,</i> 409 U. S. 434 (1973); <i>Ortwein</i> v. <i>Schwab,</i> 410 U. S. 656 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  In cases such as <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 351 U. S. 12 (1956) and <i>Douglas</i> v. <i>California,</i> 372 U. S. 353 (1963), the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause requires States that allow appellate review of criminal convictions to provide indigent defendants with trial transcripts and appellate counsel. These cases are grounded in the criminal justice system, a governmental monopoly in which participation is compelled. Cf. n. 5, <i>supra.</i> Our subsequent decisions have made it clear that the principles underlying <i>Griffin</i> and <i>Douglas</i> do not extend to legislative classifications generally.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  A woman has at least an equal right to choose to carry her fetus to term as to choose to abort it. Indeed, the right of procreation without state interference has long been recognized as \\\\\\\"one of the basic civil rights of man . . . fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race.\\\\\\\" <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535, 541 (1942).</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  Appellees rely on <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i> 394 U. S. 618 (1969), and <i>Memorial Hospital</i> v. <i>Maricopa County,</i> 415 U. S. 250 (1974). In those cases durational residence requirements for the receipt of public benefits were found to be unconstitutional because they \\\\\\\"penalized\\\\\\\" the exercise of the constitutional right to travel interstate.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>Appellees' reliance on the penalty analysis of <i>Shapiro</i> and <i>Maricopa County</i> is misplaced. In our view there is only a semantic difference between appellees' assertion that the Connecticut law unduly interferes with a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy and their assertion that it penalizes the exercise of that right. Penalties are most familiar to the criminal law, where criminal sanctions are imposed as a consequence of proscribed conduct. <i>Shapiro</i> and <i>Maricopa County</i> recognized that denial of welfare to one who had recently exercised the right to travel across state lines was sufficiently analogous to a criminal fine to justify strict judicial scrutiny.</p>\\\\n<p>If Connecticut denied general welfare benefits to all women who had obtained abortions and who were otherwise entitled to the benefits, we would have a close analogy to the facts in <i>Shapiro,</i> and strict scrutiny might be appropriate under either the penalty analysis or the analysis we have applied in our previous abortion decisions. But the claim here is that the State \\\\\\\"penalizes\\\\\\\" the woman's decision to have an abortion by refusing to pay for it. <i>Shapiro</i> and <i>Maricopa County</i> did not hold that States would penalize the right to travel interstate by refusing to pay the bus fares of the indigent travelers. We find no support in the right-to-travel cases for the view that Connecticut must show a compelling interest for its decision not to fund elective abortions.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Sherbert</i> v. <i>Verner,</i> 374 U. S. 398 (1963), similarly is inapplicable here. In addition, that case was decided in the significantly different context of a constitutionally imposed \\\\\\\"governmental obligation of neutrality\\\\\\\" originating in the Establishment and Freedom of Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 409.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  In <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo,</i> 424 U. S. 1 (1976), we drew this distinction in sustaining the public financing of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The Act provided public funds to some candidates but not to others. We rejected an asserted analogy to cases such as <i>American Party of Texas</i> v. <i>White,</i> 415 U. S. 767 (1974), which involved restrictions on access to the electoral process:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"These cases, however, dealt primarily with state laws requiring a candidate to satisfy certain requirements in order to have his name appear on the ballot. These were, of course, <i>direct burdens</i> not only on the candidate's ability to run for office but also on the voter's ability to voice preferences regarding representative government and contemporary issues. In contrast, the denial of public financing to some Presidential candidates is not restrictive of voters' rights and less restrictive of candidates'. Subtitle H does not prevent any candidate from getting on the ballot or any voter from casting a vote for the candidate of his choice; <i>the inability, if any, of minority party candidates to wage effective campaigns will derive not from lack of public funding but from their inability to raise private contributions.</i> Any disadvantage suffered by operation of the eligibility formulae under Subtitle H is thus limited to the claimed denial of the enhancement of opportunity to communicate with the electorate that the formulae afford eligible candidates.\\\\\\\" 424 U. S., at 94-95 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  In his dissenting opinion, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN rejects the distinction between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity and argues that our previous abortion decisions are inconsistent with today's decision. But as stated above, all of those decisions involved laws that placed substantial state-created obstacles in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. Our recent decision in <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977), differs only in that it involved state-created restrictions on access to contraceptives, rather than abortions. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN simply asserts that the Connecticut regulation \\\\\\\"is an obvious impairment of the fundamental right established by <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i>\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 484-485. The only suggested source for this purportedly \\\\\\\"obvious\\\\\\\" conclusion is a quotation from <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff,</i> 428 U. S. 106 (1976). Yet, as MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN was careful to note at the beginning of his opinion in <i>Singleton,</i> that case presented \\\\\\\"issues [of standing] not going to the merits of this dispute.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 108. Significantly, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN makes no effort to distinguish or explain the much more analogous authority of <i>Norwood</i> v. <i>Harrison,</i> 413 U. S. 455 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  In addition to the direct interest in protecting the fetus, a State may have legitimate demographic concerns about its rate of population growth. Such concerns are basic to the future of the State and in some circumstances could constitute a substantial reason for departure from a position of neutrality between abortion and childbirth.</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  See generally Wilkinson, The Supreme Court, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Three Faces of Constitutional Equality, 61 Va. L. Rev. 945, 998-1017 (1975).</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  Much of the rhetoric of the three dissenting opinions would be equally applicable if Connecticut had elected not to fund either abortions or childbirth. Yet none of the dissents goes so far as to argue that the Constitution <i>requires</i> such assistance for all indigent pregnant women.</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  The Court also suggests, <i>ante,</i> at 478 n. 11, that a \\\\\\\"State may have legitimate demographic concerns about its rate of population growth\\\\\\\" which might justify a choice to favor live births over abortions. While it is conceivable that under some circumstances this might be an appropriate factor to be considered as part of a State's \\\\\\\"compelling\\\\\\\" interest, no one contends that this is the case here, or indeed that Connecticut has any demographic concerns at all about the rate of its population growth.</p>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\",\"}], \"response_format\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"CaseName\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"DateOfDecision\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"CourtJurisdiction\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"StateOrCircuit\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"JudgesOnBench\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"Question6\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsUnconstitutionalStatementPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsUnconstitutionalStatementPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"Question9\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsExceedingAuthorityClaimPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsExceedingAuthorityClaimPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"Question12\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsMoralEthicalOppositionPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsMoralEthicalOppositionPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"ReasonForCitingRoe\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"SummaryOpinions\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"Majority\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"Dissenting\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"Concurring\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"Majority\"]}, \"LegislativeActionRecommendations\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreRecommendationsPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"AreRecommendationsPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"PublicOpinionAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsPublicOpinionMentioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsPublicOpinionMentioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"PrecedentReferences\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreOtherPrecedentsReferenced\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Precedents\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"TreatmentOfRoe\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"AreOtherPrecedentsReferenced\", \"Precedents\"]}, \"OutcomeOrHolding\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"RoeAuthorityAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsRoeBindingPersuasiveQuestioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsRoeBindingPersuasiveQuestioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"OtherConstitutionalGrounds\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"LegislativeDebatesAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreDebatesMentioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"AreDebatesMentioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"FutureOutlook\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsFutureOutlookSuggested\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Notes\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"IsFutureOutlookSuggested\"]}, \"AdditionalObservations\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"CaseName\", \"DateOfDecision\", \"CourtJurisdiction\", \"StateOrCircuit\", \"JudgesOnBench\", \"Question6\", \"Question9\", \"Question12\", \"SummaryOpinions\", \"LegislativeActionRecommendations\", \"PublicOpinionAnalysis\", \"PrecedentReferences\", \"OutcomeOrHolding\", \"RoeAuthorityAnalysis\", \"OtherConstitutionalGrounds\", \"LegislativeDebatesAnalysis\", \"FutureOutlook\"]}}}\n",

Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that definition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as <i>amicus curiae,</i>  the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule <i>Roe.</i> See Brief for Respondents 104-117; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8.</p>\\\\n<p>At issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, as amended in 1988 and 1989. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3203-3220 (1990). Relevant portions of the Act are set forth in the Appendix. <i>Infra,</i> at 902. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205. For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent's consent. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3206. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a \\\\\\\"medical emergency,\\\\\\\" which is defined in \\u00c2\\u00a7 3203 of the Act. See \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3203, 3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c). In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3207(b), 3214(a), 3214(f).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*845</span> Before any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a 3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. 744 F. Supp. 1323 (ED Pa. 1990). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. 947 F. 2d 682 (1991). We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 1056 (1992).</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals found it necessary to follow an elaborate course of reasoning even to identify the first premise to use to determine whether the statute enacted by Pennsylvania meets constitutional standards. See 947 F. 2d, at 687\\u00c2\\u2014 698. And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6. We disagree with that analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after <i>Roe</i>  cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, The Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding of<i>Roe</i> and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. See <i>post,</i> at 944, 966. State and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.</p>\\\\n<p>After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by <i>Roe,</i> principles of institutional integrity, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*846</span> and the rule of <i>stare decisis,</i> we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> should be retained and once again reaffirmed.</p>\\\\n<p>It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that <i>Roe</i> `s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall \\\\\\\"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\\\\\\" The controlling word in the cases before us is \\\\\\\"liberty.\\\\\\\" Although a literal reading of the Clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a State may deprive persons of liberty, for at least 105 years, since <i>Mugler</i> v. <i>Kansas,</i> 123 U. S. 623, 660-661 (1887), the Clause has been understood to contain a substantive component as well, one \\\\\\\"barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\\\\\\\" <i>Daniels</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986). As Justice Brandeis (joined by Justice Holmes) observed, \\\\\\\"[d]espite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive, it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*847</span> Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the Federal Constitution from invasion by the States.\\\\\\\" <i>Whitney</i> v. <i>California,</i> 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927) (concurring opinion). \\\\\\\"[T]he guaranties of due process, though having their roots in Magna Carta's <i>`per legem terrae'</i> and considered as procedural safeguards `against executive usurpation and tyranny,' have in this country `become bulwarks also against arbitrary legislation.' \\\\\\\" <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Ullman,</i> 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds) (quoting <i>Hurtado</i> v. <i>California,</i> 110 U. S. 516, 532 (1884)).</p>\\\\n<p>The most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Bill of Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill of Rights against the States. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Duncan</i> v. <i>Louisiana,</i>  391 U. S. 145, 147-148 (1968). It is tempting, as a means of curbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that liberty encompasses no more than those rights already guaranteed to the individual against federal interference by the express provisions of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution. See <i>Adamson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 332 U. S. 46, 68-92 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). But of course this Court has never accepted that view.</p>\\\\n<p>It is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D.,</i> 491 U. S. 110, 127-128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J.). But such a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was illegal <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*848</span> in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause in <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the Due Process Clause). Similar examples may be found in <i>Turner</i>  v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987); in <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1977); in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, 481-482 (1965), as well as in the separate opinions of a majority of the Members of the Court in that case, <i>id.,</i> at 486-488 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Brennan, J., concurring) (expressly relying on due process), <i>id.,</i> at 500-502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (same), <i>id.,</i> at 502-507 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (same); in <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510, 534-535 (1925); and in <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S. 390, 399-403 (1923).</p>\\\\n<p>Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Poe</i> v. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*849</span> <i>Ullman, supra,</i> at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Justice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue the full Court did not reach in <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Ullman</i><i>,</i> but the Court adopted his position four Terms later in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut, supra</i><i>.</i> In <i>Griswold,</i> we held that the Constitution does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to use contraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed, under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples. See <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438 (1972). Constitutional protection was extended to the sale and distribution of contraceptives in <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International, supra</i><i>.</i> It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, see <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland,</i> 431 U. S. 494 (1977); <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535 (1942); <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska, supra</i><i>,</i> as well as bodily integrity, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Washington</i> v. <i>Harper,</i> 494 U. S. 210, 221-222 (1990); <i>Winston</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> 470 U. S. 753 (1985); <i>Rochin</i> v. <i>California,</i> 342 U. S. 165 (1952).</p>\\\\n<p>The inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit us to shrink from the duties of our office. As Justice Harlan observed:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*850</span> The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society. If the supplying of content to this Constitutional concept has of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\\\\\\\" <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Ullman,</i> 367 U. S., at 542 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>See also <i>Rochin</i> v. <i>California, supra,</i> at 171-172 (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) (\\\\\\\"To believe that this judicial exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing `due process of law' at some fixed stage of time or thought is to suggest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudication is a function for inanimate machines and not for judges\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*851</span> in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.</p>\\\\n<p>It is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ferguson</i> v. <i>Skrupa,</i> 372 U. S. 726 (1963); <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> 348 U. S. 483 (1955). That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that a State may not compel or enforce one view or the other. See <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> 319 U. S. 624 (1943); <i>Texas</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 491 U. S. 397 (1989).</p>\\\\n<p>Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S., at 685. Our cases recognize \\\\\\\"the right of the <i>individual,</i> married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\\\\\\" <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird, supra,</i> at 453 (emphasis in original). Our precedents \\\\\\\"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\\\\\\\" <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*852</span> These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear. That these sacrifices have from the beginning of the human race been endured by woman with a pride that ennobles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bond of love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist she make the sacrifice. Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture. The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.</p>\\\\n<p>It should be recognized, moreover, that in some critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character as the decision to use contraception, to which <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i><i>, </i><i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird</i><i>,</i> and <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International</i> afford constitutional protection. We have no doubt as to the correctness of those decisions. They support <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*853</span> the reasoning in <i>Roe</i> relating to the woman's liberty because they involve personal decisions concerning not only the meaning of procreation but also human responsibility and respect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will have differences of opinion about these matters. One view is based on such reverence for the wonder of creation that any pregnancy ought to be welcomed and carried to full term no matter how difficult it will be to provide for the child and ensure its well-being. Another is that the inability to provide for the nurture and care of the infant is a cruelty to the child and an anguish to the parent. These are intimate views with infinite variations, and their deep, personal character underlay our decisions in <i>Griswold, Eisenstadt,</i> and <i>Carey.</i> The same concerns are present when the woman confronts the reality that, perhaps despite her attempts to avoid it, she has become pregnant.</p>\\\\n<p>It was this dimension of personal liberty that <i>Roe</i> sought to protect, and its holding invoked the reasoning and the tradition of the precedents we have discussed, granting protection to substantive liberties of the person. <i>Roe</i> was, of course, an extension of those cases and, as the decision itself indicated, the separate States could act in some degree to further their own legitimate interests in protecting prenatal life. The extent to which the legislatures of the States might act to outweigh the interests of the woman in choosing to terminate her pregnancy was a subject of debate both in <i>Roe</i> itself and in decisions following it.</p>\\\\n<p>While we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on behalf of the State in the cases before us, arguments which in their ultimate formulation conclude that <i>Roe</i> should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of <i>Roe</i> are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combined with the force of <i>stare decisis.</i> We turn now to that doctrine.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*854</span> III</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity, and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Cardozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society's work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it. See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 1991 Journal of Supreme Court History 13, 16. At the other extreme, a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.</p>\\\\n<p>Even when the decision to overrule a prior case is not, as in the rare, latter instance, virtually foreordained, it is common wisdom that the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is not an \\\\\\\"inexorable command,\\\\\\\" and certainly it is not such in every constitutional case, see <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See also <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 501 U. S. 808, 842 (1991) (Souter, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring); <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Rumsey,</i> 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984). Rather, when this Court reexamines a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case. Thus, for example, we may ask whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability, <i>Swift &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Wickham,</i> 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation, <i>e. g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Title Ins. &amp; Trust</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*855</span> <i>Co.,</i> 265 U. S. 472, 486 (1924); whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, see <i>Patterson</i>  v. <i>McLean Credit Union,</i> 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989); or whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification, <i>e. g., </i><i>Burnet, supra,</i> at 412 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>So in this case we may enquire whether <i>Roe</i> `s central rule has been found unworkable; whether the rule's limitation on state power could be removed without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it; whether the law's growth in the intervening years has left <i>Roe's</i> central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whether <i>Roe</i> `s premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevant or unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>Although <i>Roe</i> has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven \\\\\\\"unworkable,\\\\\\\" see <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985), representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable. While <i>Roe</i> has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choice guaranteed against government infringement, and although the need for such review will remain as a consequence of today's decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>2</h2>\\\\n<p>The inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on the rule's continued application. Since the classic case for weighing reliance heavily in favor of following the earlier rule occurs in the commercial context, see <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennes-</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*856</span> <i>see, supra,</i> at 828, where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity, it is no cause for surprise that some would find no reliance worthy of consideration in support of <i>Roe.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>While neither respondents nor their <i>amici</i> in so many words deny that the abortion right invites some reliance prior to its actual exercise, one can readily imagine an argument stressing the dissimilarity of this case to one involving property or contract. Abortion is customarily chosen as an unplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activity or to the failure of conventional birth control, and except on the assumption that no intercourse would have occurred but for <i>Roe</i> `s holding, such behavior may appear to justify no reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on that unrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance interest would be <i>de minimis.</i> This argument would be premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.</p>\\\\n<p>To eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances of sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. See, <i>e. g.,</i> R. Petchesky, Abortion and Woman's Choice 109, 133, n. 7 (rev. ed. 1990). The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on <i>Roe</i> cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling <i>Roe</i> for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*857</span> 3</h2>\\\\n<p>No evolution of legal principle has left <i>Roe</i> `s doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left <i>Roe</i> behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.</p>\\\\n<p>It will be recognized, of course, that <i>Roe</i> stands at an intersection of two lines of decisions, but in whichever doctrinal category one reads the case, the result for present purposes will be the same. The <i>Roe</i> Court itself placed its holding in the succession of cases most prominently exemplified by <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 152-153. When it is so seen, <i>Roe</i> is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, the scope of recognized protection accorded to the liberty relating to intimate relationships, the family, and decisions about whether or not to beget or bear a child. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977); <i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland,</i> 431 U. S. 494 (1977).</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe,</i> however, may be seen not only as an exemplar of <i>Griswold</i> liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so, our cases since <i>Roe</i> accord with <i>Roe</i> `s view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. <i>Cruzan</i> v. <i>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,</i> 497 U. S. 261, 278 (1990); cf., <i>e. g., </i><i>Riggins</i> v. <i>Nevada,</i> 504 U. S. 127, 135 (1992); <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Harper,</i> 494 U. S. 210 (1990); see also, <i>e. g., </i><i>Rochin</i> v. <i>California,</i> 342 U. S. 165 (1952); <i>Jacobson</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 197 U. S. 11, 24-30 (1905).</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, one could classify <i>Roe</i> as <i>sui generis.</i> If the case is so viewed, then there clearly has been no erosion of its central determination. The original holding resting on the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*858</span> concurrence of seven Members of the Court in 1973 was expressly affirmed by a majority of six in 1983, see <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 <i>(Akron I)</i><i>,</i> and by a majority of five in 1986, see <i>Thornburgh</i>  v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i>  476 U. S. 747, expressing adherence to the constitutional ruling despite legislative efforts in some States to test its limits. More recently, in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989), although two of the present authors questioned the trimester framework in a way consistent with our judgment today, see <i>id.,</i> at 518 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 529 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a majority of the Court either decided to reaffirm or declined to address the constitutional validity of the central holding of <i>Roe.</i> See <i>Webster,</i> 492 U. S., at 521 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 525-526 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 537, 553 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 561-563 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>Nor will courts building upon <i>Roe</i> be likely to hand down erroneous decisions as a consequence. Even on the assumption that the central holding of <i>Roe</i> was in error, that error would go only to the strength of the state interest in fetal protection, not to the recognition afforded by the Constitution to the woman's liberty. The latter aspect of the decision fits comfortably within the framework of the Court's prior decisions, including <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535 (1942); <i>Griswold, supra; Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438 (1972), the holdings of which are \\\\\\\"not a series of isolated points,\\\\\\\" but mark a \\\\\\\"rational continuum.\\\\\\\" <i>Poe</i> v. <i>Ullman,</i>  367 U. S., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting). As we described in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*859</span> <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International, supra</i><i>,</i> the liberty which encompasses those decisions</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"includes `the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.' While the outer limits of this aspect of [protected liberty] have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions `relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.' \\\\\\\" 431 U. S., at 684-685 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The soundness of this prong of the <i>Roe</i> analysis is apparent from a consideration of the alternative. If indeed the woman's interest in deciding whether to bear and beget a child had not been recognized as in <i>Roe,</i> the State might as readily restrict a woman's right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term as to terminate it, to further asserted state interests in population control, or eugenics, for example. Yet <i>Roe</i> has been sensibly relied upon to counter any such suggestions. <i>E. g., </i><i>Arnold</i> v. <i>Board of Education of Escambia County, Ala.,</i> 880 F. 2d 305, 311 (CA11 1989) (relying upon <i>Roe</i> and concluding that government officials violate the Constitution by coercing a minor to have an abortion); <i>Avery</i> v. <i>County of Burke,</i> 660 F. 2d 111, 115 (CA4 1981) (county agency inducing teenage girl to undergo unwanted sterilization on the basis of misrepresentation that she had sickle cell trait); see also <i>In re Quinlan,</i> 70 N. J. 10, 355 A. 2d 647 (relying on <i>Roe</i> in finding a right to terminate medical treatment), cert. denied <i>sub nom. </i><i>Garger</i> v. <i>New Jersey,</i> 429 U. S. 922 (1976)). In any event, because <i>Roe</i> `s scope is confined by the fact of its concern with postconception potential life, a concern otherwise likely to be implicated only by some forms of contraception protected independently under <i>Griswold</i> and later cases, any error in <i>Roe</i> is unlikely to have serious ramifications in future cases.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*860</span> 4</h2>\\\\n<p>We have seen how time has overtaken some of <i>Roe</i> `s factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, see <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 429, n. 11, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. Compare <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 160, with <i>Webster, supra,</i> at 515-516 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); see <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 457, and n. 5 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of <i>Roe</i> `s central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of <i>Roe,</i> at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future. Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since <i>Roe</i> was decided; which is to say that no change in <i>Roe</i> `s factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>5</h2>\\\\n<p>The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows <i>Roe</i> `s underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume <i>Roe</i> `s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left <i>Roe</i> `s central holding a doctrinal remnant; <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*861</span> <i>Roe</i> portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. Within the bounds of normal <i>stare decisis</i> analysis, then, and subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming <i>Roe</i> `s central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for overruling it.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>In a less significant case, <i>stare decisis</i> analysis could, and would, stop at the point we have reached. But the sustained and widespread debate <i>Roe</i> has provoked calls for some comparison between that case and others of comparable dimension that have responded to national controversies and taken on the impress of the controversies addressed. Only two such decisional lines from the past century present themselves for examination, and in each instance the result reached by the Court accorded with the principles we apply today.</p>\\\\n<p>The first example is that line of cases identified with <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 198 U. S. 45 (1905), which imposed substantive limitations on legislation limiting economic autonomy in favor of health and welfare regulation, adopting, in Justice Holmes's view, the theory of laissez-faire. <i>Id.,</i> at 75 (dissenting opinion). The <i>Lochner</i> decisions were exemplified by <i>Adkins</i> v. <i>Children's Hospital of District of Columbia,</i> 261 U. S. 525 (1923), in which this Court held it to be an infringement of constitutionally protected liberty of contract to require the employers of adult women to satisfy minimum wage standards. Fourteen years later, <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i>  v. <i>Parrish,</i> 300 U. S. 379 (1937), signaled the demise of <i>Lochner</i> by overruling <i>Adkins.</i> In the meantime, the Depression had come and, with it, the lesson that seemed unmistakable to most people by 1937, that the interpretation of contractual freedom protected in <i>Adkins</i> rested on fundamentally <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*862</span> false factual assumptions about the capacity of a relatively unregulated market to satisfy minimal levels of human welfare. See <i>West Coast Hotel Co., supra,</i> at 399. As Justice Jackson wrote of the constitutional crisis of 1937 shortly before he came on the bench: \\\\\\\"The older world of <i>laissez faire</i> was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.\\\\\\\" The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). The facts upon which the earlier case had premised a constitutional resolution of social controversy had proven to be untrue, and history's demonstration of their untruth not only justified but required the new choice of constitutional principle that <i>West Coast Hotel</i> announced. Of course, it was true that the Court lost something by its misperception, or its lack of prescience, and the Court-packing crisis only magnified the loss; but the clear demonstration that the facts of economic life were different from those previously assumed warranted the repudiation of the old law.</p>\\\\n<p>The second comparison that 20th century history invites is with the cases employing the separate-but-equal rule for applying the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. They began with <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537 (1896), holding that legislatively mandated racial segregation in public transportation works no denial of equal protection, rejecting the argument that racial separation enforced by the legal machinery of American society treats the black race as inferior. The <i>Plessy</i> Court considered \\\\\\\"the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 551. Whether, as a matter of historical fact, the Justices in the <i>Plessy</i> majority believed this or not, see <i>id.,</i> at 557, 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting), this understanding of the implication of segregation was the stated justification for the Court's opinion. But this understanding of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*863</span> the facts and the rule it was stated to justify were repudiated in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954) <i>(Brown I)</i><i>.</i> As one commentator observed, the question before the Court in <i>Brown</i> was \\\\\\\"whether discrimination inheres in that segregation which is imposed by law in the twentieth century in certain specific states in the American Union. And that question has meaning and can find an answer only on the ground of history and of common knowledge about the facts of life in the times and places aforesaid.\\\\\\\" Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L. J. 421, 427 (1960).</p>\\\\n<p>The Court in <i>Brown</i> addressed these facts of life by observing that whatever may have been the understanding in <i>Plessy</i> `s time of the power of segregation to stigmatize those who were segregated with a \\\\\\\"badge of inferiority,\\\\\\\" it was clear by 1954 that legally sanctioned segregation had just such an effect, to the point that racially separate public educational facilities were deemed inherently unequal. 347 U. S., at 494-495. Society's understanding of the facts upon which a constitutional ruling was sought in 1954 was thus fundamentally different from the basis claimed for the decision in 1896. While we think <i>Plessy</i> was wrong the day it was decided, see <i>Plessy, supra,</i> at 552-564 (Harlan, J., dissenting), we must also recognize that the <i>Plessy</i> Court's explanation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the facts apparent to the Court in 1954 that the decision to reexamine <i>Plessy</i> was on this ground alone not only justified but required.</p>\\\\n<p><i>West Coast Hotel</i> and <i>Brown</i> each rested on facts, or an understanding of facts, changed from those which furnished the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutional resolutions. Each case was comprehensible as the Court's response to facts that the country could understand, or had come to understand already, but which the Court of an earlier day, as its own declarations disclosed, had not been able to perceive. As the decisions were thus comprehensible <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*864</span> they were also defensible, not merely as the victories of one doctrinal school over another by dint of numbers (victories though they were), but as applications of constitutional principle to facts as they had not been seen by the Court before. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations, and the thoughtful part of the Nation could accept each decision to overrule a prior case as a response to the Court's constitutional duty.</p>\\\\n<p>Because the cases before us present no such occasion it could be seen as no such response. Because neither the factual underpinnings of <i>Roe</i> `s central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law for no other reason than that would run counter to the view repeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided. See<i>, e. g., </i><i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>W. T. Grant Co.,</i> 416 U. S. 600, 636 (1974) (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"A basic change in the law upon a ground no firmer than a change in our membership invites the popular misconception that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government. No misconception could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve\\\\\\\"); <i>Mapp</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 367 U. S. 643, 677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>The examination of the conditions justifying the repudiation of <i>Adkins</i> by <i>West Coast Hotel</i> and <i>Plessy</i> by <i>Brown</i> is enough to suggest the terrible price that would have been paid if the Court had not overruled as it did. In the present cases, however, as our analysis to this point makes clear, the terrible price would be paid for overruling. Our analysis <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*865</span> would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling <i>Roe</i> `s central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. To understand why this would be so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court's authority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, and its relationship to the country's understanding of itself as a constitutional Republic.</p>\\\\n<p>The root of American governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees. The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people's acceptance of the Judiciary as fit to determine what the Nation's law means and to declare what it demands.</p>\\\\n<p>The underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions, and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision without principled justification would be no judicial act at all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because not every conscientious claim of principled justification will be accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond dispute. The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*866</span> obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the Nation.</p>\\\\n<p>The need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appellate court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactory explanation in most cases. People understand that some of the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that the Court's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another, the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.</p>\\\\n<p>In two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling prior cases. There is, first, a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as, at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong. There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior Courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable reexamination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.</p>\\\\n<p>That first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in <i>Roe</i> and those rare, comparable cases, its <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*867</span> decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the Nation only twice in our lifetime, in the decisions of <i>Brown</i> and <i>Roe.</i> But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed from principles worthy of profound respect. But whatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question. Cf. <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) <i>(Brown II)</i>  (\\\\\\\"[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of th[e] constitutional principles [announced in <i>Brown I,</i> ] cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>The country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary would be underscored by an equally certain and equally reasonable condemnation for another failing in overruling unnecessarily and under pressure. Some cost will be paid by anyone who approves or implements a constitutional decision where it is unpopular, or who refuses to work to undermine the decision or to force its reversal. The price may be criticism or ostracism, or it may be violence. An extra price will be paid by those who themselves disapprove of the decision's results <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*868</span> when viewed outside of constitutional terms, but who nevertheless struggle to accept it, because they respect the rule of law. To all those who will be so tested by following, the Court implicitly undertakes to remain steadfast, lest in the end a price be paid for nothing. The promise of constancy, once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to stand by the decision survives and the understanding of the issue has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. From the obligation of this promise this Court cannot and should not assume any exemption when duty requires it to decide a case in conformance with the Constitution. A willing breach of it would be nothing less than a breach of faith, and no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle in the decision by which it did that.</p>\\\\n<p>It is true that diminished legitimacy may be restored, but only slowly. Unlike the political branches, a Court thus weakened could not seek to regain its position with a new mandate from the voters, and even if the Court could somehow go to the polls, the loss of its principled character could not be retrieved by the casting of so many votes. Like the character of an individual, the legitimacy of the Court must be earned over time. So, indeed, must be the character of a Nation of people who aspire to live according to the rule of law. Their belief in themselves as such a people is not readily separable from their understanding of the Court invested with the authority to decide their constitutional cases and speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. If the Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so would the country be in its very ability to see itself through its constitutional ideals. The Court's concern with legitimacy is not for the sake of the Court, but for the sake of the Nation to which it is responsible.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's duty in the present cases is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*869</span> to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it provided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new social consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the decision, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense. A decision to overrule <i>Roe</i> `s essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the Nation's commitment to the rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the essence of <i>Roe</i> `s original decision, and we do so today.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>From what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in <i>Roe</i> was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.</p>\\\\n<p>That brings us, of course, to the point where much criticism has been directed at <i>Roe,</i> a criticism that always inheres when the Court draws a specific rule from what in the Constitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however, that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in the meaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear. And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman's liberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to full term.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*870</span> We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for two reasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of <i>stare decisis.</i> Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat arbitrary, but <i>Roe</i> was a reasoned statement, elaborated with great care. We have twice reaffirmed it in the face of great opposition. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 759; <i>Akron I</i> , 462 U. S., at 419-420. Although we must overrule those parts of <i>Thornburgh</i> and <i>Akron I</i> which, in our view, are inconsistent with <i>Roe</i> `s statement that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn, see <i>infra,</i> at 882-883, the central premise of those cases represents an unbroken commitment by this Court to the essential holding of <i>Roe.</i> It is that premise which we reaffirm today.</p>\\\\n<p>The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in <i>Roe,</i> is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. See <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 163. Consistent with other constitutional norms, legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification. But courts may not. We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no line other than viability which is more workable. To be sure, as we have said, there may be some medical developments that affect the precise point of viability, see <i>supra,</i> at 860, but this is an imprecision within tolerable limits given that the medical community and all those who must apply its discoveries will continue to explore the matter. The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*871</span> The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.</p>\\\\n<p>On the other side of the equation is the interest of the State in the protection of potential life. The <i>Roe</i> Court recognized the State's \\\\\\\"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 162. The weight to be given this state interest, not the strength of the woman's interest, was the difficult question faced in <i>Roe.</i> We do not need to say whether each of us, had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of the state interest came before it as an original matter, would have concluded, as the <i>Roe</i> Court did, that its weight is insufficient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability even when it is subject to certain exceptions. The matter is not before us in the first instance, and coming as it does after nearly 20 years of litigation in <i>Roe</i> `s wake we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of <i>Roe</i> `s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding. And we have concluded that the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> should be reaffirmed.</p>\\\\n<p>Yet it must be remembered that <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also the State's \\\\\\\"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 163. That portion of the decision in <i>Roe</i> has been given too little acknowledgment and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases. Those cases decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 427. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the holding in <i>Roe</i> itself that the State has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life within her. In resolving this tension, we choose to rely upon <i>Roe,</i> as against the later cases.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*872</span> <i>Roe</i> established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimester of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the woman's health, but not to further the State's interest in potential life, are permitted during the second trimester; and during the third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are permitted provided the life or health of the mother is not at stake. <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 163-166. Most of our cases since <i>Roe</i>  have involved the application of rules derived from the trimester framework. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Akron I, supra</i><i>.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>The trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however, that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this objective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessary and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the State's permissible exercise of its powers.</p>\\\\n<p>Though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child herself. \\\\\\\"`[T]he Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth.' \\\\\\\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S., at 511 (opinion of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*873</span> the Court) (quoting <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519, 521 (1977)). It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we find consistent with <i>Roe</i> `s central premises, and indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.</p>\\\\n<p>We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of <i>Roe.</i> See <i>Webster</i>  v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S., at 518 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); <i>id.,</i> at 529 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (describing the trimester framework as \\\\\\\"problematic\\\\\\\"). Measures aimed at ensuring that a woman's choice contemplates the consequences for the fetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized in <i>Roe,</i> although those measures have been found to be inconsistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in that case. A logical reading of the central holding in <i>Roe</i> itself, and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the woman and the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, require, in our view, that we abandon the trimester framework as a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed at the protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practice it undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recognized in <i>Roe.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>As our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a right more difficult to exercise is, <i>ipso facto,</i> an infringement of that right. An example clarifies the point. We have held that not every ballot access limitation amounts to an infringement of the right to vote. Rather, the States are granted substantial flexibility in establishing the framework within which voters choose the candidates for whom they <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*874</span> wish to vote. <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Celebrezze,</i> 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983); <i>Norman</i> v. <i>Reed,</i> 502 U. S. 279 (1992).</p>\\\\n<p>The abortion right is similar. Numerous forms of state regulation might have the incidental effect of increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of medical care, whether for abortion or any other medical procedure. The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. See <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S. 417, 458-459 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S. 502, 519-520 (1990) <i>(Akron II)</i> (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services, supra,</i> at 530 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 462 U. S. 506, 520 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i>  v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476, 505 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>Akron I,</i>  462 U. S., at 464 (O'Connor, J., joined by White and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976) <i>(Bellotti I)</i> .</p>\\\\n<p>For the most part, the Court's early abortion cases adhered to this view. In <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, 473-474 (1977), the Court explained: \\\\\\\"<i>Roe</i> did not declare an unqualified `constitutional right to an abortion,' as the District Court seemed to think. Rather, the right protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" See <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*875</span> also <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 198 (1973) (\\\\\\\"[T]he interposition of the hospital abortion committee is unduly restrictive of the patient's rights\\\\\\\"); <i>Bellotti I, supra,</i> at 147 (State may not \\\\\\\"impose undue burdens upon a minor capable of giving an informed consent\\\\\\\"); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980) (citing <i>Maher, supra</i> ). Cf. <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S., at 688 (\\\\\\\"[T]he same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual's right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>These considerations of the nature of the abortion right illustrate that it is an overstatement to describe it as a right to decide whether to have an abortion \\\\\\\"without interference from the State.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976). All abortion regulations interfere to some degree with a woman's ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. It is, as a consequence, not surprising that despite the protestations contained in the original <i>Roe</i> opinion to the effect that the Court was not recognizing an absolute right, 410 U. S., at 154-155, the Court's experience applying the trimester framework has led to the striking down of some abortion regulations which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision. Those decisions went too far because the right recognized by <i>Roe</i> is a right \\\\\\\"to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\\\\\\" <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S., at 453. Not all governmental intrusion is of necessity unwarranted; and that brings us to the other basic flaw in the trimester framework: even in <i>Roe</i> `s terms, in practice it undervalues the State's interest in the potential life within the woman.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> was express in its recognition of the State's \\\\\\\"important and legitimate interest[s] in preserving and protecting <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*876</span> the health of the pregnant woman [and] in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 162. The trimester framework, however, does not fulfill <i>Roe</i> `s own promise that the State has an interest in protecting fetal life or potential life. <i>Roe</i> began the contradiction by using the trimester framework to forbid any regulation of abortion designed to advance that interest before viability. <i>Id.,</i> at 163. Before viability, <i>Roe</i> and subsequent cases treat all governmental attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of the potential life within her as unwarranted. This treatment is, in our judgment, incompatible with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy. Cf. <i>Webster,</i> 492 U. S., at 519 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 461 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on the right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy will be undue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State's interest with the woman's constitutionally protected liberty.</p>\\\\n<p>The concept of an undue burden has been utilized by the Court as well as individual Members of the Court, including two of us, in ways that could be considered inconsistent. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota, supra,</i> at 459-461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <i>Akron II, supra,</i> at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra,</i> at 828-829 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 461-466 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae, supra,</i> at 314; <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 473; <i>Beal</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 438, 446 (1977); <i>Bellotti I, supra,</i> at 147. Because we set forth a standard of general application to which we intend to adhere, it is important to clarify what is meant by an undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*877</span> A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which, while furthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. To the extent that the opinions of the Court or of individual Justices use the undue burden standard in a manner that is inconsistent with this analysis, we set out what in our view should be the controlling standard. Cf. <i>McCleskey</i> v. <i>Zant,</i> 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991) (attempting \\\\\\\"to define the doctrine of abuse of the writ with more precision\\\\\\\" after acknowledging tension among earlier cases). In our considered judgment, an undue burden is an unconstitutional burden. See <i>Akron II,</i> 497 U. S., at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Understood another way, we answer the question, left open in previous opinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whether a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability could be constitutional. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 462-463 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The answer is no.</p>\\\\n<p>Some guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. See <i>infra,</i> at 899-900 (addressing Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*878</span> Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p>Even when jurists reason from shared premises, some disagreement is inevitable. Compare <i>Hodgson,</i> 497 U. S., at 482-497 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with <i>id.,</i> at 458-460 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part). That is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden standard. We give this summary:</p>\\\\n<p>(a) To protect the central right recognized by <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>  while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.</p>\\\\n<p>(b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> To promote the State's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.</p>\\\\n<p>(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*879</span> (d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> and we reaffirm that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.</p>\\\\n<p>(e) We also reaffirm <i>Roe</i> `s holding that \\\\\\\"subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 164-165.</p>\\\\n<p>These principles control our assessment of the Pennsylvania statute, and we now turn to the issue of the validity of its challenged provisions.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>V</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals applied what it believed to be the undue burden standard and upheld each of the provisions except for the husband notification requirement. We agree generally with this conclusion, but refine the undue burden analysis in accordance with the principles articulated above. We now consider the separate statutory sections at issue.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Because it is central to the operation of various other requirements, we begin with the statute's definition of medical emergency. Under the statute, a medical emergency is</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\\\\\\\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3203 (1990).</blockquote>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*880</span> Petitioners argue that the definition is too narrow, contending that it forecloses the possibility of an immediate abortion despite some significant health risks. If the contention were correct, we would be required to invalidate the restrictive operation of the provision, for the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health. 410 U. S., at 164. See also <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S., at 316.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court found that there were three serious conditions which would not be covered by the statute: preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature ruptured membrane. 744 F. Supp., at 1378. Yet, as the Court of Appeals observed, 947 F. 2d, at 700-701, it is undisputed that under some circumstances each of these conditions could lead to an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences. While the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court of Appeals construed the phrase \\\\\\\"serious risk\\\\\\\" to include those circumstances. <i>Id.,</i> at 701. It stated: \\\\\\\"[W]e read the medical emergency exception as intended by the Pennsylvania legislature to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> As we said in <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U. S. 491, 499-500 (1985): \\\\\\\"Normally, . . . we defer to the construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal courts.\\\\\\\" Indeed, we have said that we will defer to lower court interpretations of state law unless they amount to \\\\\\\"plain\\\\\\\" error. <i>Palmer</i> v. <i>Hoffman,</i> 318 U. S. 109, 118 (1943). This \\\\\\\"`reflect[s] our belief that district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.' \\\\\\\" <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988) (citation omitted). We adhere to that course today, and conclude that, as construed by the Court of Appeals, the medical emergency definition imposes no undue burden on a woman's abortion right.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*881</span> B</h2>\\\\n<p>We next consider the informed consent requirement. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205 (1990). Except in a medical emergency, the statute requires that at least 24 hours before performing an abortion a physician inform the woman of the nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and the \\\\\\\"probable gestational age of the unborn child.\\\\\\\" The physician or a qualified nonphysician must inform the woman of the availability of printed materials published by the State describing the fetus and providing information about medical assistance for childbirth, information about child support from the father, and a list of agencies which provide adoption and other services as alternatives to abortion. An abortion may not be performed unless the woman certifies in writing that she has been informed of the availability of these printed materials and has been provided them if she chooses to view them.</p>\\\\n<p>Our prior decisions establish that as with any medical procedure, the State may require a woman to give her written informed consent to an abortion. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 67. In this respect, the statute is unexceptional. Petitioners challenge the statute's definition of informed consent because it includes the provision of specific information by the doctor and the mandatory 24-hour waiting period. The conclusions reached by a majority of the Justices in the separate opinions filed today and the undue burden standard adopted in this opinion require us to overrule in part some of the Court's past decisions, decisions driven by the trimester framework's prohibition of all previability regulations designed to further the State's interest in fetal life.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983), we invalidated an ordinance which required that a woman seeking an abortion be provided by her physician with specific information \\\\\\\"designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 444. As we later described <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*882</span> the <i>Akron I</i> holding in <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 762, there were two purported flaws in the Akron ordinance: the information was designed to dissuade the woman from having an abortion and the ordinance imposed \\\\\\\"a rigid requirement that a specific body of information be given in all cases, irrespective of the particular needs of the patient . . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>To the extent <i>Akron I</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> find a constitutional violation when the government requires, as it does here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the nature of the procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the \\\\\\\"probable gestational age\\\\\\\" of the fetus, those cases go too far, are inconsistent with <i>Roe</i> `s acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled. This is clear even on the very terms of <i>Akron I</i> and <i>Thornburgh.</i> Those decisions, along with <i>Danforth,</i> recognize a substantial government interest justifying a requirement that a woman be apprised of the health risks of abortion and childbirth. <i>E. g., </i><i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 66-67. It cannot be questioned that psychological well-being is a facet of health. Nor can it be doubted that most women considering an abortion would deem the impact on the fetus relevant, if not dispositive, to the decision. In attempting to ensure that a woman apprehend the full consequences of her decision, the State furthers the legitimate purpose of reducing the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed. If the information the State requires to be made available to the woman is truthful and not misleading, the requirement may be permissible.</p>\\\\n<p>We also see no reason why the State may not require doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the availability of materials relating to the consequences to the fetus, even when those consequences have no direct relation to her health. An example illustrates the point. We would think <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*883</span> it constitutional for the State to require that in order for there to be informed consent to a kidney transplant operation the recipient must be supplied with information about risks to the donor as well as risks to himself or herself. A requirement that the physician make available information similar to that mandated by the statute here was described in <i>Thornburgh</i> as \\\\\\\"an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician.\\\\\\\" 476 U. S., at 762. We conclude, however, that informed choice need not be defined in such narrow terms that all considerations of the effect on the fetus are made irrelevant. As we have made clear, we depart from the holdings of <i>Akron I</i> and <i>Thornburgh</i> to the extent that we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protecting the life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensuring a decision that is mature and informed, even when in so doing the State expresses a preference for childbirth over abortion. In short, requiring that the woman be informed of the availability of information relating to fetal development and the assistance available should she decide to carry the pregnancy to full term is a reasonable measure to ensure an informed choice, one which might cause the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. This requirement cannot be considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion, and, it follows, there is no undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p>Our prior cases also suggest that the \\\\\\\"straitjacket,\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at 762 (quoting <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 67, n. 8), of particular information which must be given in each case interferes with a constitutional right of privacy between a pregnant woman and her physician. As a preliminary matter, it is worth noting that the statute now before us does not require a physician to comply with the informed consent provisions \\\\\\\"if he or she can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she reasonably believed that furnishing the information would have resulted in a severely <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*884</span> adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the patient.\\\\\\\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205 (1990). In this respect, the statute does not prevent the physician from exercising his or her medical judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it is derivative of the woman's position. The doctor-patient relation does not underlie or override the two more general rights under which the abortion right is justified: the right to make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy. On its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts. Thus, a requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion is, for constitutional purposes, no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>All that is left of petitioners' argument is an asserted First Amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a manner mandated by the State. To be sure, the physician's First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated, see <i>Wooley</i>  v. <i>Maynard,</i> 430 U. S. 705 (1977), but only as part of the practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State, cf. <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, 603 (1977). We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the State here.</p>\\\\n<p>The Pennsylvania statute also requires us to reconsider the holding in <i>Akron I</i> that the State may not require that a physician, as opposed to a qualified assistant, provide information relevant to a woman's informed consent. 462 U. S., at 448. Since there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion, we conclude that it is not <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*885</span> an undue burden. Our cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others. See <i>Williamson</i>  v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> 348 U. S. 483 (1955). Thus, we uphold the provision as a reasonable means to ensure that the woman's consent is informed.</p>\\\\n<p>Our analysis of Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consent and the performance of an abortion under the undue burden standard requires us to reconsider the premise behind the decision in <i>Akron I</i> invalidating a parallel requirement. In <i>Akron I</i> we said: \\\\\\\"Nor are we convinced that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 450. We consider that conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable, particularly where the statute directs that important information become part of the background of the decision. The statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals, permits avoidance of the waiting period in the event of a medical emergency and the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable health risk. In theory, at least, the waiting period is a reasonable measure to implement the State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn, a measure that does not amount to an undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p>Whether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonetheless invalid because in practice it is a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closer question. The findings of fact by the District Court indicate that because of the distances many women must travel to reach an abortion provider, the practical effect will often be <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*886</span> a delay of much more than a day because the waiting period requires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least two visits to the doctor. The District Court also found that in many instances this will increase the exposure of women seeking abortions to \\\\\\\"the harassment and hostility of antiabortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.\\\\\\\" 744 F. Supp., at 1351. As a result, the District Court found that for those women who have the fewest financial resources, those who must travel long distances, and those who have difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will be \\\\\\\"particularly burdensome.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1352.</p>\\\\n<p>These findings are troubling in some respects, but they do not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes an undue burden. We do not doubt that, as the District Court held, the waiting period has the effect of \\\\\\\"increasing the cost and risk of delay of abortions,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 1378, but the District Court did not conclude that the increased costs and potential delays amount to substantial obstacles. Rather, applying the trimester framework's strict prohibition of all regulation designed to promote the State's interest in potential life before viability, see <i>id.,</i> at 1374, the District Court concluded that the waiting period does not further the state \\\\\\\"interest in maternal health\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"infringes the physician's discretion to exercise sound medical judgment,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 1378. Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is permitted to enact persuasive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a health interest. And while the waiting period does limit a physician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to invalidate it. In light of the construction given the statute's definition of medical emergency by the Court of Appeals, and the District Court's findings, we cannot say that the waiting period imposes a real health risk.</p>\\\\n<p>We also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the \\\\\\\"particularly burdensome\\\\\\\" effects of the waiting period <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*887</span> on some women require its invalidation. A particular burden is not of necessity a substantial obstacle. Whether a burden falls on a particular group is a distinct inquiry from whether it is a substantial obstacle even as to the women in that group. And the District Court did not conclude that the waiting period is such an obstacle even for the women who are most burdened by it. Hence, on the record before us, and in the context of this facial challenge, we are not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an undue burden.</p>\\\\n<p>We are left with the argument that the various aspects of the informed consent requirement are unconstitutional because they place barriers in the way of abortion on demand. Even the broadest reading of <i>Roe,</i> however, has not suggested that there is a constitutional right to abortion on demand. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S., at 189. Rather, the right protected by <i>Roe</i> is a right to decide to terminate a pregnancy free of undue interference by the State. Because the informed consent requirement facilitates the wise exercise of that right, it cannot be classified as an interference with the right <i>Roe</i> protects. The informed consent requirement is not an undue burden on that right.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, except in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shall perform an abortion on a married woman without receiving a signed statement from the woman that she has notified her spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. The woman has the option of providing an alternative signed statement certifying that her husband is not the man who impregnated her; that her husband could not be located; that the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault which she has reported; or that the woman believes that notifying her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodily injury upon her. A physician who performs an abortion on <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*888</span> a married woman without receiving the appropriate signed statement will have his or her license revoked, and is liable to the husband for damages.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court heard the testimony of numerous expert witnesses, and made detailed findings of fact regarding the effect of this statute. These included:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"273. The vast majority of women consult their husbands prior to deciding to terminate their pregnancy. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<p>. . . . .</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"279. The `bodily injury' exception could not be invoked by a married woman whose husband, if notified, would, in her reasonable belief, threaten to (a) publicize her intent to have an abortion to family, friends or acquaintances; (b) retaliate against her in future child custody or divorce proceedings; (c) inflict psychological intimidation or emotional harm upon her, her children or other persons; (d) inflict bodily harm on other persons such as children, family members or other loved ones; or (e) use his control over finances to deprive of necessary monies for herself or her children. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<p>. . . . .</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"281. Studies reveal that family violence occurs in two million families in the United States. This figure, however, is a conservative one that substantially understates (because battering is usually not reported until it reaches life-threatening proportions) the actual number of families affected by domestic violence. In fact, researchers estimate that one of every two women will be battered at some time in their life. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"282. A wife may not elect to notify her husband of her intention to have an abortion for a variety of reasons, including the husband's illness, concern about her own health, the imminent failure of the marriage, or the husband's absolute opposition to the abortion. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"283. The required filing of the spousal consent form would require plaintiff-clinics to change their counseling <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*889</span> procedures and force women to reveal their most intimate decision-making on pain of criminal sanctions. The confidentiality of these revelations could not be guaranteed, since the woman's records are not immune from subpoena. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"284. Women of all class levels, educational backgrounds, and racial, ethnic and religious groups are battered. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"285. Wife-battering or abuse can take on many physical and psychological forms. The nature and scope of the battering can cover a broad range of actions and be gruesome and torturous. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"286. Married women, victims of battering, have been killed in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"287. Battering can often involve a substantial amount of sexual abuse, including marital rape and sexual mutilation. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"288. In a domestic abuse situation, it is common for the battering husband to also abuse the children in an attempt to coerce the wife. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"289. Mere notification of pregnancy is frequently a flashpoint for battering and violence within the family. The number of battering incidents is high during the pregnancy and often the worst abuse can be associated with pregnancy. . . . The battering husband may deny parentage and use the pregnancy as an excuse for abuse. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"290. Secrecy typically shrouds abusive families. Family members are instructed not to tell anyone, especially police or doctors, about the abuse and violence. Battering husbands often threaten their wives or her children with further abuse if she tells an outsider of the violence and tells her that nobody will believe her. A battered woman, therefore, is highly unlikely to disclose <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*890</span> the violence against her for fear of retaliation by the abuser. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"291. Even when confronted directly by medical personnel or other helping professionals, battered women often will not admit to the battering because they have not admitted to themselves that they are battered. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<p>. . . . .</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"294. A woman in a shelter or a safe house unknown to her husband is not `reasonably likely' to have bodily harm inflicted upon her by her batterer, however her attempt to notify her husband pursuant to section 3209 could accidentally disclose her whereabouts to her husband. Her fear of future ramifications would be realistic under the circumstances.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"295. Marital rape is rarely discussed with others or reported to law enforcement authorities, and of those reported only few are prosecuted. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"296. It is common for battered women to have sexual intercourse with their husbands to avoid being battered. While this type of coercive sexual activity would be spousal sexual assault as defined by the Act, many women may not consider it to be so and others would fear disbelief. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"297. The marital rape exception to section 3209 cannot be claimed by women who are victims of coercive sexual behavior other than penetration. The 90-day reporting requirement of the spousal sexual assault statute, 18 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3218(c), further narrows the class of sexually abused wives who can claim the exception, since many of these women may be psychologically unable to discuss or report the rape for several years after the incident. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"298. Because of the nature of the battering relationship, battered women are unlikely to avail themselves of the exceptions to section 3209 of the Act, regardless of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*891</span> whether the section applies to them.\\\\\\\" 744 F. Supp., at 1360-1362 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>These findings are supported by studies of domestic violence. The American Medical Association (AMA) has published a summary of the recent research in this field, which indicates that in an average 12-month period in this country, approximately two million women are the victims of severe assaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, women reported that nearly one of every eight husbands had assaulted their wives during the past year. The AMA views these figures as \\\\\\\"marked underestimates,\\\\\\\" because the nature of these incidents discourages women from reporting them, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor, those who do not speak English well, and women who are homeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey is conducted. According to the AMA, \\\\\\\"[r]esearchers on family violence agree that the true incidence of partner violence is probably <i>double</i> the above estimates; or four million severely assaulted women per year. Studies on prevalence suggest that from one-fifth to one-third of all women will be physically assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their lifetime.\\\\\\\" AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, Violence Against Women 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidents involve sexual assault. <i>Id.,</i> at 3-4; Shields &amp; Hanneke,</p>\\\\n<p>Battered Wives' Reactions to Marital Rape, in The Dark Side of Families: Current Family Violence Research 131, 144 (D. Finkelhor, R. Gelles, G. Hataling, &amp; M. Straus eds. 1983). In families where wifebeating takes place, moreover, child abuse is often present as well. Violence Against Women, <i>supra,</i> at 12.</p>\\\\n<p>Other studies fill in the rest of this troubling picture. Physical violence is only the most visible form of abuse. Psychological abuse, particularly forced social and economic isolation of women, is also common. L. Walker, The Battered <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*892</span> Woman Syndrome 27-28 (1984). Many victims of domestic violence remain with their abusers, perhaps because they perceive no superior alternative. Herbert, Silver, &amp; Ellard, Coping with an Abusive Relationship: I. How and Why do Women Stay?, 53 J. Marriage &amp; the Family 311 (1991). Many abused women who find temporary refuge in shelters return to their husbands, in large part because they have no other source of income. Aguirre, Why Do They Return? Abused Wives in Shelters, 30 J. Nat. Assn. of Social Workers 350, 352 (1985). Returning to one's abuser can be dangerous. Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics disclose that 8.8 percent of all homicide victims in the United States are killed by their spouses. Mercy &amp; Saltzman, Fatal Violence Among Spouses in the United States, 1976-85, 79 Am. J. Public Health 595 (1989). Thirty percent of female homicide victims are killed by their male partners. Domestic Violence: Terrorism in the Home, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1990).</p>\\\\n<p>The limited research that has been conducted with respect to notifying one's husband about an abortion, although involving samples too small to be representative, also supports the District Court's findings of fact. The vast majority of women notify their male partners of their decision to obtain an abortion. In many cases in which married women do not notify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an extramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the primary reason women do not notify their husbands is that the husband and wife are experiencing marital difficulties, often accompanied by incidents of violence. Ryan &amp; Plutzer, When Married Women Have Abortions: Spousal Notification and Marital Interaction, 51 J. Marriage &amp; the Family 41, 44 (1989).</p>\\\\n<p>This information and the District Court's findings reinforce what common sense would suggest. In wellfunctioning <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*893</span> marriages, spouses discuss important intimate decisions such as whether to bear a child. But there are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological abuse at the hands of their husbands. Should these women become pregnant, they may have very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Many may have justifiable fears of physical abuse, but may be no less fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a reasonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke further instances of child abuse; these women are not exempt from \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209's notification requirement. Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands, including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and friends. These methods of psychological abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to notification than the possibility of physical violence, but women who are the victims of the abuse are not exempt from \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209's notification requirement. And many women who are pregnant as a result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable to avail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the woman have notified law enforcement authorities within 90 days of the assault, and her husband will be notified of her report once an investigation begins, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3128(c). If anything in this field is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault are extremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government; hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exempt from the notification requirement imposed by \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209.</p>\\\\n<p>The spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*894</span> a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases.</p>\\\\n<p>Respondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 is invalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden at all for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. They begin by noting that only about 20 percent of the women who obtain abortions are married. They then note that of these women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abortions. Respondents argue that since some of these women will be able to notify their husbands without adverse consequences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statute affects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions. For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalid on its face. See Brief for Respondents 83-86. We disagree with respondents' basic method of analysis.</p>\\\\n<p>The analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, we would not say that a law which requires a newspaper to print a candidate's reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on its face because most newspapers would adopt the policy even absent the law. See <i>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</i> v. <i>Tornillo,</i> 418 U. S. 241 (1974). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.</p>\\\\n<p>Respondents' argument itself gives implicit recognition to this principle, at one of its critical points. Respondents speak of the one percent of women seeking abortions who are married and would choose not to notify their husbands of their plans. By selecting as the controlling class women <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*895</span> who wish to obtain abortions, rather than all women or all pregnant women, respondents in effect concede that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 must be judged by reference to those for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction. Of course, as we have said, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209's real target is narrower even than the class of women seeking abortions identified by the State: it is married women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify their husbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for one of the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement. The unfortunate yet persisting conditions we document above will mean that in a large fraction of the cases in which \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion. It is an undue burden, and therefore invalid.</p>\\\\n<p>This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions upholding parental notification or consent requirements. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akron II,</i> 497 U. S., at 510-519; <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i>  443 U. S. 622 (1979) <i>(Bellotti II)</i><i>; </i><i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 74. Those enactments, and our judgment that they are constitutional, are based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumption about adult women.</p>\\\\n<p>We recognize that a husband has a \\\\\\\"deep and proper concern and interest . . . in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.\\\\\\\" <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 69. With regard to the children he has fathered and raised, the Court has recognized his \\\\\\\"cognizable and substantial\\\\\\\" interest in their custody. <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645, 651-652 (1972); see also <i>Quilloin</i> v. <i>Walcott,</i> 434 U. S. 246 (1978); <i>Caban</i> v. <i>Mohammed,</i> 441 U. S. 380 (1979); <i>Lehr</i> v. <i>Robertson,</i> 463 U. S. 248 (1983). If these cases concerned a State's ability to require the mother to notify the father before taking some action with respect to a living <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*896</span> child raised by both, therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude as a general matter that the father's interest in the welfare of the child and the mother's interest are equal.</p>\\\\n<p>Before birth, however, the issue takes on a very different cast. It is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have a far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the father's. The effect of state regulation on a woman's protected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case, as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere of the family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant woman. Cf. <i>Cruzan</i> v. <i>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,</i> 497 U. S., at 281. The Court has held that \\\\\\\"when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.\\\\\\\" <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 71. This conclusion rests upon the basic nature of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: \\\\\\\"[T]he marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the <i>individual,</i> married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\\\\\\" <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S., at 453 (emphasis in original). The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike, from unjustified state interference, even when that interference is enacted into law for the benefit of their spouses.</p>\\\\n<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when a different understanding of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. In <i>Bradwell</i> v. <i>State,</i> 16 Wall. 130 (1873), three Members of this <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*897</span> Court reaffirmed the common-law principle that \\\\\\\"a woman had no legal existence separate from her husband, who was regarded as her head and representative in the social state; and, notwithstanding some recent modifications of this civil status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and dependent upon this cardinal principle still exist in full force in most States.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 141 (Bradley, J., joined by Swayne and Field, JJ., concurring in judgment). Only one generation has passed since this Court observed that \\\\\\\"woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life,\\\\\\\" with attendant \\\\\\\"special responsibilities\\\\\\\" that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution. <i>Hoyt</i> v. <i>Florida,</i> 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). These views, of course, are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>In keeping with our rejection of the common-law understanding of a woman's role within the family, the Court held in <i>Danforth</i> that the Constitution does not permit a State to require a married woman to obtain her husband's consent before undergoing an abortion. 428 U. S., at 69. The principles that guided the Court in <i>Danforth</i> should be our guides today. For the great many women who are victims of abuse inflicted by their husbands, or whose children are the victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's decision. Whether the prospect of notification itself deters such women from seeking abortions, or whether the husband, through physical force or psychological pressure or economic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abortion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often be tantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in <i>Danforth.</i>  The women most affected by this law\\u00c2\\u2014those who most reasonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbands that they are pregnant\\u00c2\\u2014are in the gravest danger.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*898</span> The husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him with this troubling degree of authority over his wife. The contrary view leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law. A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a husband's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a wife's liberty, the State could require a married woman to notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiring pregnant married women to notify their husbands before engaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all,if the husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a sufficient predicate for state regulation, the State could reasonably conclude that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before drinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married women should notify their husbands before using contraceptives or before undergoing any type of surgery that may have complications affecting the husband's interest in his wife's reproductive organs. And if a husband's interest justifies notice in any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that it justifies exactly what the <i>Danforth</i> Court held it did not justify\\u00c2\\u2014a requirement of the husband's consent as well. A State may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant to our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual's family. These considerations confirm our conclusion that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 is invalid.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*899</span> D</h2>\\\\n<p>We next consider the parental consent provision. Except in a medical emergency, an unemancipated young woman under 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one of her parents (or guardian) provides informed consent as defined above. If neither a parent nor a guardian provides consent, a court may authorize the performance of an abortion upon a determination that the young woman is mature and capable of giving informed consent and has in fact given her informed consent, or that an abortion would be in her best interests.</p>\\\\n<p>We have been over most of this ground before. Our cases establish, and we reaffirm today, that a State may require a minor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian, provided that there is an adequate judicial bypass procedure. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akron II,</i> 497 U. S., at 510-519; <i>Hodgson,</i> 497 U. S., at 461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); <i>id.,</i> at 497-501 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 440; <i>Bellotti II,</i> 443 U. S., at 643-644 (plurality opinion). Under these precedents, in our view, the one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass procedure are constitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>The only argument made by petitioners respecting this provision and to which our prior decisions do not speak is the contention that the parental consent requirement is invalid because it requires informed parental consent. For the most part, petitioners' argument is a reprise of their argument with respect to the informed consent requirement in general, and we reject it for the reasons given above. Indeed, some of the provisions regarding informed consent have particular force with respect to minors: the waiting period, for example, may provide the parent or parents of a pregnant young woman the opportunity to consult with her in private, and to discuss the consequences of her decision in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*900</span> the context of the values and moral or religious principles of their family. See <i>Hodgson, supra,</i> at 448-449 (opinion of Stevens, J.).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>E</h2>\\\\n<p>Under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the statute, every facility which performs abortions is required to file a report stating its name and address as well as the name and address of any related entity, such as a controlling or subsidiary organization. In the case of statefunded institutions, the information becomes public.</p>\\\\n<p>For each abortion performed, a report must be filed identifying: the physician (and the second physician where required); the facility; the referring physician or agency; the woman's age; the number of prior pregnancies and prior abortions she has had; gestational age; the type of abortion procedure; the date of the abortion; whether there were any pre-existing medical conditions which would complicate pregnancy; medical complications with the abortion; where applicable, the basis for the determination that the abortion was medically necessary; the weight of the aborted fetus; and whether the woman was married, and if so, whether notice was provided or the basis for the failure to give notice. Every abortion facility must also file quarterly reports showing the number of abortions performed broken down by trimester. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3207, 3214 (1990). In all events, the identity of each woman who has had an abortion remains confidential.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 80, we held that recordkeeping and reporting provisions \\\\\\\"that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible.\\\\\\\" We think that under this standard, all the provisions at issue here, except that relating to spousal notice, are constitutional. Although they do not relate to the State's interest in informing the woman's choice, they do relate to health. The collection of information with respect to actual patients <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*901</span> is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult. Nor do we find that the requirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice. At most they might increase the cost of some abortions by a slight amount. While at some point increased cost could become a substantial obstacle, there is no such showing on the record before us.</p>\\\\n<p>Subsection (12) of the reporting provision requires the reporting of, among other things, a married woman's \\\\\\\"reason for failure to provide notice\\\\\\\" to her husband. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3214(a)(12). This provision in effect requires women, as a condition of obtaining an abortion, to provide the Commonwealth with the precise information we have already recognized that many women have pressing reasons not to reveal. Like the spousal notice requirement itself, this provision places an undue burden on a woman's choice, and must be invalidated for that reason.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>VI</h2>\\\\n<p>Our Constitution is a covenant running from the first generation of Americans to us and then to future generations. It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms embody ideas and aspirations that must survive more ages than one. We accept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting the full meaning of the covenant in light of all of our precedents. We invoke it once again to define the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution's own promise, the promise of liberty.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>The judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed.

In deciding whether to grant such consent, a pregnant woman's parent or guardian shall consider only their child's or ward's best interests.

The materials shall provide information on the availability of medical assistance benefits for prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care, and state that it is unlawful for any individual to coerce a woman to undergo abortion, that any physician who performs an abortion upon a woman without obtaining her informed consent or without according her a private medical consultation may be liable to her for damages in a civil action at law, that the father of a child is liable to assist in the support of that child, even in instances where the father has offered to pay for an abortion and that the law permits adoptive parents to pay costs of prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(2) Materials designed to inform the woman of the probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two-week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including pictures representing the development of unborn children at two-week gestational increments, and any relevant information on the possibility of the unborn child's survival; provided that any such pictures or drawings must contain the dimensions of the fetus and must be realistic and appropriate for the woman's stage of pregnancy. The materials shall be objective, non-judgmental and designed <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*908</span> to convey only accurate scientific information about the unborn child at the various gestational ages. The material shall also contain objective information describing the methods of abortion procedures commonly employed, the medical risks commonly associated with each such procedure, the possible detrimental psychological effects of abortion and the medical risks commonly associated with each such procedure and the medical risks commonly associated with carrying a child to term.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(b) Format.\\u00c2\\u2014The materials shall be printed in a typeface large enough to be clearly legible.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(c) Free distribution.\\u00c2\\u2014The materials required under this section shall be available at no cost from the department upon request and in appropriate number to any person, facility or hospital.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u00a7 3209.

The report forms shall not identify the individual patient by name and shall include the following information:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(1) Identification of the physician who performed the abortion, the concurring physician as required by section 3211(c)(2) (relating to abortion on unborn child of 24 or more weeks gestational age), the second physician as required by section 3211(c)(5) and the facility where the abortion was performed and of the referring physician, agency or service, if any.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(2) The county and state in which the woman resides.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(3) The woman's age.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(4) The number of prior pregnancies and prior abortions of the woman.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(5) The gestational age of the unborn child at the time of the abortion.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(6) The type of procedure performed or prescribed and the date of the abortion.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(7) Pre-existing medical conditions of the woman which would complicate pregnancy, if any, and if known, any medical complication which resulted from the abortion itself.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(8) The basis for the medical judgment of the physician who performed the abortion that the abortion was necessary to prevent either the death of the pregnant woman or the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the woman, where an abortion has been performed pursuant to section 3211(b)(1).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(9) The weight of the aborted child for any abortion performed pursuant to section 3211(b)(1).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(10) Basis for any medical judgment that a medical emergency existed which excused the physician from compliance with any provision of this chapter.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*911</span> \\\\\\\"(11) The information required to be reported under section 3210(a) (relating to determination of gestational age).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"(12) Whether the abortion was performed upon a married woman and, if so, whether notice to her spouse was given. If no notice to her spouse was given, the report shall also indicate the reason for failure to provide notice.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>. . . . .</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(f) Report by facility.\\u00c2\\u2014Every facility in which an abortion is performed within this Commonwealth during any quarter year shall file with the department a report showing the total number of abortions performed within the hospital or other facility during that quarter year. This report shall also show the total abortions performed in each trimester of pregnancy. Any report shall be available for public inspection and copying only if the facility receives Stateappropriated funds within the 12-calendar-month period immediately preceding the filing of the report. These reports shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the department which will enable a facility to indicate whether or not it is receiving State-appropriated funds. If the facility indicates on the form that it is not receiving State-appropriated funds, the department shall regard its report as confidential unless it receives other evidence which causes it to conclude that the facility receives State-appropriated funds.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>The portions of the Court's opinion that I have joined are more important than those with which I disagree. I shall therefore first comment on significant areas of agreement, and then explain the limited character of my disagreement.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*912</span> I</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> has controlling significance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual Justice's concerns about the merits.<sup>[1]</sup> The central holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), has been a \\\\\\\"part of our law\\\\\\\" for almost two decades. <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i>  428 U. S. 52, 101 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See also <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678, 687, 702 (1977) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). The societal costs of overruling <i>Roe</i> at this late date would be enormous. <i>Roe</i> is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> also provides a sufficient basis for my agreement with the joint opinion's reaffirmation of <i>Roe</i> `s postviability analysis. Specifically, I accept the proposition that \\\\\\\"[i]f the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 163-164; see <i>ante,</i> at 879.</p>\\\\n<p>I also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaffirmation of <i>Roe</i> `s explanation of <i>why</i> the State's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*913</span> must take precedence over any duty to the unborn. The Court in <i>Roe</i> carefully considered, and rejected, the State's argument \\\\\\\"that the fetus is a `person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 156. After analyzing the usage of \\\\\\\"person\\\\\\\" in the Constitution, the Court concluded that that word \\\\\\\"has application only postnatally.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 157. Commenting on the contingent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: \\\\\\\"Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 162. Accordingly, an abortion is not \\\\\\\"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 159. From this holding, there was no dissent, see <i>id.,</i> at 173; indeed, no Member of the Court has ever questioned this fundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a \\\\\\\"person\\\\\\\" does not have what is sometimes described as a \\\\\\\"right to life.\\\\\\\"<sup>[2]</sup> This has been and, by the Court's holding today, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*914</span> remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>My disagreement with the joint opinion begins with its understanding of the trimester framework established in <i>Roe.</i> Contrary to the suggestion of the joint opinion, <i>ante,</i>  at 876, it is not a \\\\\\\"contradiction\\\\\\\" to recognize that the State may have a legitimate interest in potential human life and, at the same time, to conclude that that interest does not justify the regulation of abortion before viability (although other interests, such as maternal health, may). The fact that the State's interest is legitimate does not tell us when, if ever, that interest outweighs the pregnant woman's interest in personal liberty. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider more carefully the nature of the interests at stake.</p>\\\\n<p>First, it is clear that, in order to be legitimate, the State's interest must be secular; consistent with the First Amendment the State may not promote a theological or sectarian interest. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring); see generally <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 563-572 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussed above, the state interest in potential human life is not an interest <i>in loco parentis,</i> for the fetus is not a person.</p>\\\\n<p>Identifying the State's interests\\u00c2\\u2014which the States rarely articulate with any precision\\u00c2\\u2014makes clear that the interest in protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitution. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by both humanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizens believe that any abortion reflects an unacceptable disrespect for potential human life and that the performance of more <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*915</span> than a million abortions each year is intolerable; many find third-trimester abortions performed when the fetus is approaching personhood particularly offensive. The State has a legitimate interest in minimizing such offense. The State may also have a broader interest in expanding the population,<sup>[3]</sup> believing society would benefit from the services of additional productive citizens\\u00c2\\u2014or that the potential human lives might include the occasional Mozart or Curie. These are the kinds of concerns that comprise the State's interest in potential human life.</p>\\\\n<p>In counterpoise is the woman's constitutional interest in liberty. One aspect of this liberty is a right to bodily integrity, a right to control one's person. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Rochin</i> v. <i>California,</i> 342 U. S. 165 (1952); <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535 (1942). This right is neutral on the question of abortion: The Constitution would be equally offended by an absolute requirement that all women undergo abortions as by an absolute prohibition on abortions. \\\\\\\"Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.\\\\\\\" <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Georgia,</i> 394 U. S. 557, 565 (1969). The same holds true for the power to control women's bodies.</p>\\\\n<p>The woman's constitutional liberty interest also involves her freedom to decide matters of the highest privacy and the most personal nature. Cf. <i>Whalen</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 429 U. S. 589, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*916</span> 598-600 (1977). A woman considering abortion faces \\\\\\\"a difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to her own future\\u00c2\\u2014perhaps to the salvation of her own immortal soul.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 781. The authority to make such traumatic and yet empowering decisions is an element of basic human dignity. As the joint opinion so eloquently demonstrates, a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is nothing less than a matter of conscience.</p>\\\\n<p>Weighing the State's interest in potential life and the woman's liberty interest, I agree with the joint opinion that the State may \\\\\\\"` \\\\\\\"expres[s] a preference for normal childbirth,\\\\\\\"` \\\\\\\" that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice \\\\\\\"is thoughtful and informed,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 872-873. Serious questions arise, however, when a State attempts to \\\\\\\"persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to inject into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of what is best. The State may promote its preferences by funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect the individual's freedom to make such judgments.</p>\\\\n<p>This theme runs throughout our decisions concerning reproductive freedom. In general, <i>Roe</i> `s requirement that restrictions on abortions before viability be justified by the State's interest in <i>maternal</i> health has prevented States from interjecting regulations designed to influence a woman's decision. Thus, we have upheld regulations of abortion that are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice, but rather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of that decision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects of her decision. We have, for example, upheld regulations requiring <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*917</span> written informed consent, see <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976); limited recordkeeping and reporting, see <i>ibid.;</i> and pathology reports, see <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983); as well as various licensing and qualification provisions, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 150; <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 462 U. S. 506 (1983). Conversely, we have consistently rejected state efforts to prejudice a woman's choice, either by limiting the information available to her, see <i>Bigelow</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 421 U. S. 809 (1975), or by \\\\\\\"requir[ing] the delivery of information designed `to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' \\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 760; see also <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 442-449 (1983).</p>\\\\n<p>In my opinion, the principles established in this long line of cases and the wisdom reflected in Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in <i>Akron</i> (and followed by the Court just six years ago in <i>Thornburgh</i> ) should govern our decision today. Under these principles, Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)\\u00c2\\u2014(iii) (1990) of the Pennsylvania statute are unconstitutional. Those sections require a physician or counselor to provide the woman with a range of materials clearly designed to persuade her to choose not to undergo the abortion. While the Commonwealth is free, pursuant to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3208 of the Pennsylvania law, to produce and disseminate such material, the Commonwealth may not inject such information into the woman's deliberations just as she is weighing such an important choice.</p>\\\\n<p>Under this same analysis, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are constitutional. Those sections, which require the physician to inform a woman of the nature and risks of the abortion procedure and the medical risks of carrying to term, are neutral requirements comparable to those imposed in other medical procedures. Those sections indicate no effort by the Commonwealth to influence the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*918</span> woman's choice in any way. If anything, such requirements <i>enhance,</i> rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The 24-hour waiting period required by \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(1)\\u00c2\\u2014(2) of the Pennsylvania statute raises even more serious concerns. Such a requirement arguably furthers the Commonwealth's interests in two ways, neither of which is constitutionally permissible.</p>\\\\n<p>First, it may be argued that the 24-hour delay is justified by the mere fact that it is likely to reduce the number of abortions, thus furthering the Commonwealth's interest in potential life. But such an argument would justify any form of coercion that placed an obstacle in the woman's path. The Commonwealth cannot further its interests by simply wearing down the ability of the pregnant woman to exercise her constitutional right.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, it can more reasonably be argued that the 24-hour delay furthers the Commonwealth's interest in ensuring that the woman's decision is informed and thoughtful. But there is no evidence that the mandated delay benefits women or that it is necessary to enable the physician to convey any relevant information to the patient. The mandatory delay thus appears to rest on outmoded and unacceptable assumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women. While there are well-established and consistently maintained reasons for the Commonwealth to view with skepticism the ability of minors to make decisions, see <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i>  497 U. S. 417, 449 (1990),<sup>[4]</sup> none of those reasons applies to an <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*919</span> adult woman's decisionmaking ability. Just as we have left behind the belief that a woman must consult her husband before undertaking serious matters, see <i>ante,</i> at 895-898, so we must reject the notion that a woman is less capable of deciding matters of gravity. Cf. <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Reed,</i> 404 U. S. 71 (1971).</p>\\\\n<p>In the alternative, the delay requirement may be premised on the belief that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is presumptively wrong. This premise is illegitimate. Those who disagree vehemently about the legality and morality of abortion agree about one thing: The decision to terminate a pregnancy is profound and difficult. No person undertakes such a decision lightly\\u00c2\\u2014and States may not presume that a woman has failed to reflect adequately merely because her conclusion differs from the State's preference. A woman who has, in the privacy of her thoughts and conscience, weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forced to reconsider all, simply because the State believes she has come to the wrong conclusion.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*920</span> Part of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equal dignity to which each of us is entitled. A woman who decides to terminate her pregnancy is entitled to the same respect as a woman who decides to carry the fetus to term. The mandatory waiting period denies women that equal respect.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>In my opinion, a correct application of the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard leads to the same conclusion concerning the constitutionality of these requirements. A state-imposed burden on the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by its effects and by its character: A burden may be \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\" either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate, rational justification.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The 24-hour delay requirement fails both parts of this test. The findings of the District Court establish the severity of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*921</span> the burden that the 24-hour delay imposes on many pregnant women. Yet even in those cases in which the delay is not especially onerous, it is,in my opinion, \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\" because there is no evidence that such a delay serves a useful and legitimate purpose. As indicated above, there is no legitimate reason to require a woman who has agonized over her decision to leave the clinic or hospital and return again another day. While a general requirement that a physician notify her patients about the risks of a proposed medical procedure is appropriate, a rigid requirement that all patients wait 24 hours or (what is true in practice) much longer to evaluate the significance of information that is either common knowledge or irrelevant is an irrational and, therefore, \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\" burden.</p>\\\\n<p>The counseling provisions are similarly infirm. Whenever government commands private citizens to speak or to listen, careful review of the justification for that command is particularly appropriate. In these cases, the Pennsylvania statute directs that counselors provide women seeking abortions with information concerning alternatives to abortion, the availability of medical assistance benefits, and the possibility of child-support payments. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)\\u00c2\\u2014(iii). The statute requires that this information be given to <i>all</i> women seeking abortions, including those for whom such information is clearly useless, such as those who are married, those who have undergone the procedure in the past and are fully aware of the options, and those who are fully convinced that abortion is their only reasonable option. Moreover, the statute requires physicians to inform all of their patients of \\\\\\\"[t]he probable gestational age of the unborn child.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(ii). This information is of little decisional value in most cases, because 90% of all abortions are performed during the first trimester<sup>[7]</sup> when fetal age has less relevance than when the fetus nears viability. Nor can the information <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*922</span> required by the statute be justified as relevant to any \\\\\\\"philosophic\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"social\\\\\\\" argument, <i>ante,</i> at 872, either favoring or disfavoring the abortion decision in a particular case. In light of all of these facts, I conclude that the information requirements in \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(ii) and \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)\\u00c2\\u2014(iii) do not serve a useful purpose and thus constitute an unnecessary\\u00c2\\u2014 and therefore undue\\u00c2\\u2014burden on the woman's constitutional liberty to decide to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p>Accordingly, while I disagree with Parts IV, V\\u00c2\\u2014B, and V\\u00c2\\u2014D of the joint opinion,<sup>[8]</sup> I join the remainder of the Court's opinion.</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Blackmun, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>I join Parts I, II, III, V\\u00c2\\u2014A, V\\u00c2\\u2014C, and VI of the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, <i>ante.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>Three years ago, in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989), four Members of this Court appeared poised to \\\\\\\"cas[t] into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country\\\\\\\" who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproductive choice. <i>Id.,</i> at 557 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). See <i>id.,</i>  at 499 (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 532 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). All that remained between the promise of <i>Roe</i> and the darkness of the plurality was a single, flickering flame. Decisions since <i>Webster</i> gave little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S. 502, 524 (1990) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*923</span> I do not underestimate the significance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protection afforded by this Court before <i>Webster.</i> And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the light.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in which Justices O'Connor and Kennedy postponed reconsideration of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that \\\\\\\"the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 846. In brief, five Members of this Court today recognize that \\\\\\\"the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 844.</p>\\\\n<p>A fervent view of individual liberty and the force of <i>stare decisis</i> have led the Court to this conclusion. <i>Ante,</i> at 853. Today a majority reaffirms that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes \\\\\\\"a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 847\\u00c2\\u2014 a realm whose outer limits cannot be determined by interpretations of the Constitution that focus only on the specific practices of States at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. See <i>ante,</i> at 848-849. Included within this realm of liberty is \\\\\\\"`the right of the <i>individual,</i> married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 851, quoting <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972) (emphasis in original). \\\\\\\"These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are <i>central</i> to the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*924</span> liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 851 (emphasis added). Finally, the Court today recognizes that in the case of abortion, \\\\\\\"the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 852.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's reaffirmation of <i>Roe</i> `s central holding is also based on the force of <i>stare decisis.</i> \\\\\\\"[N]o erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left <i>Roe</i> `s central holding a doctrinal remnant; <i>Roe</i> portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 860-861. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that <i>Roe</i> `s limitation on state power could not be removed \\\\\\\"without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 855. In the 19 years since <i>Roe</i>  was decided, that case has shaped more than reproductive planning\\u00c2\\u2014\\\\\\\"[a]n entire generation has come of age free to assume <i>Roe</i> `s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 860. The Court understands that, having \\\\\\\"call[ed] the contending sides . . . to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 867, a decision to overrule <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 865. What has happened today should serve as a model for future Justices and a warning to all who have tried to turn this Court into yet another political branch.</p>\\\\n<p>In striking down the Pennsylvania statute's spousal notification requirement, the Court has established a framework <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*925</span> for evaluating abortion regulations that responds to the social context of women facing issues of reproductive choice.<sup>[1]</sup> In determining the burden imposed by the challenged regulation, the Court inquires whether the regulation's \\\\\\\"<i>purpose or effect</i> is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 878 (emphasis added). The Court reaffirms: \\\\\\\"The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 894. Looking at this group, the Court inquires, based on expert testimony, empirical studies, and common sense, whether \\\\\\\"in a large fraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895. \\\\\\\"A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 877. And in applying its test, the Court remains sensitive to the unique role of women in the decision making process. Whatever may have been the practice when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, the Court observes, \\\\\\\"[w]omen do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual's family.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 898.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*926</span> Lastly, while I believe that the joint opinion errs in failing to invalidate the other regulations, I am pleased that the joint opinion has not ruled out the possibility that these regulations may be shown to impose an unconstitutional burden. The joint opinion makes clear that its specific holdings are based on the insufficiency of the record before it. See, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 885-886. I am confident that in the future evidence will be produced to show that \\\\\\\"in a large fraction of the cases in which [these regulations are] relevant, [they] will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and decisions of this Court require that a State's abortion restrictions be subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny. Our precedents and the joint opinion's principles require us to subject all non-<i>de-minimis</i> abortion regulations to strict scrutiny. Under this standard, the Pennsylvania statute's provisions requiring content-based counseling, a 24-hour delay, informed parental consent, and reporting of abortionrelated information must be invalidated.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court today reaffirms the long recognized rights of privacy and bodily integrity. As early as 1891, the Court held, \\\\\\\"[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others . . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Union Pacific R. Co.</i> v. <i>Botsford,</i> 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891). Throughout this century, this Court also has held that the fundamental right of privacy protects citizens against governmental intrusion <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*927</span> in such intimate family matters as procreation, childrearing, marriage, and contraceptive choice. See <i>ante,</i> at 847-849. These cases embody the principle that personal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity, and destiny should be largely beyond the reach of government. <i>Eisenstadt,</i> 405 U. S., at 453. In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> this Court correctly applied these principles to a woman's right to choose abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>State restrictions on abortion violate a woman's right of privacy in two ways. First, compelled continuation of a pregnancy infringes upon a woman's right to bodily integrity by imposing substantial physical intrusions and significant risks of physical harm. During pregnancy, women experience dramatic physical changes and a wide range of health consequences. Labor and delivery pose additional health risks and physical demands. In short, restrictive abortion laws force women to endure physical invasions far more substantial than those this Court has held to violate the constitutional principle of bodily integrity in other contexts. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Winston</i> v. <i>Lee,</i> 470 U. S. 753 (1985) (invalidating surgical removal of bullet from murder suspect); <i>Rochin</i> v. <i>California,</i> 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (invalidating stomach pumping).<sup>[3]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Further, when the State restricts a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, it deprives a woman of the right to make her own decision about reproduction and family planning\\u00c2\\u2014critical life choices that this Court long has deemed central to the right to privacy. The decision to terminate or continue a pregnancy has no less an impact on a woman's life than decisions about contraception or marriage. 410 U. S., <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*928</span> at 153. Because motherhood has a dramatic impact on a woman's educational prospects, employment opportunities, and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws deprive her of basic control over her life. For these reasons, \\\\\\\"the decision whether or not to beget or bear a child\\\\\\\" lies at \\\\\\\"the very heart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices.\\\\\\\" <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678, 685 (1977).</p>\\\\n<p>A State's restrictions on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of gender equality. State restrictions on abortion compel women to continue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. By restricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State conscripts women's bodies into its service, forcing women to continue their pregnancies, suffer the pains of childbirth, and in most instances, provide years of maternal care. The State does not compensate women for their services; instead, it assumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. This assumption\\u00c2\\u2014that women can simply be forced to accept the \\\\\\\"natural\\\\\\\" status and incidents of motherhood\\u00c2\\u2014appears to rest upon a conception of women's role that has triggered the protection of the Equal Protection Clause. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Mississippi Univ. for Women</i> v. <i>Hogan,</i> 458 U. S. 718, 724-726 (1982); <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren,</i> 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976).<sup>[4]</sup> The joint opinion recognizes that these assumptions about women's place in society \\\\\\\"are no longer consistent with our <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*929</span> understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 897.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court has held that limitations on the right of privacy are permissible only if they survive \\\\\\\"strict\\\\\\\" constitutional scrutiny\\u00c2\\u2014that is, only if the governmental entity imposing the restriction can demonstrate that the limitation is both necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, 485 (1965). We have applied this principle specifically in the context of abortion regulations. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 155.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> implemented these principles through a framework that was designed \\\\\\\"to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 872. <i>Roe</i> identified two relevant state interests: \\\\\\\"an interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman\\\\\\\" and an interest in \\\\\\\"protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 162. With respect to the State's interest in the health of the mother, \\\\\\\"the `compelling' point . . . is at approximately the end of the first trimester,\\\\\\\" because it is at that point that the mortality rate in abortion approaches that in childbirth. <i>Id.,</i> at 163. With respect to the State's interest in potential life, \\\\\\\"the `compelling' point is at viability,\\\\\\\" because it is at that point that the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*930</span> fetus \\\\\\\"presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> In order to fulfill the requirement of narrow tailoring, \\\\\\\"the State is obligated to make a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulations to the period in the trimester during which its health interest will be furthered.\\\\\\\" <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 434 (1983).</p>\\\\n<p>In my view, application of this analytical framework is no less warranted than when it was approved by seven Members of this Court in <i>Roe.</i> Strict scrutiny of state limitations on reproductive choice still offers the most secure protection of the woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from state coercion. No majority of this Court has ever agreed upon an alternative approach. The factual premises of the trimester framework have not been undermined, see <i>Webster,</i> 492 U. S., at 553 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and the <i>Roe</i> framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard adopted by the joint opinion.</p>\\\\n<p>Nonetheless, three criticisms of the trimester framework continue to be uttered. First, the trimester framework is attacked because its key elements do not appear in the text of the Constitution. My response to this attack remains the same as it was in <i>Webster:</i></p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Were this a true concern, we would have to abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. [T]he `critical elements' of countless constitutional doctrines nowhere appear in the Constitution's text . . . . The Constitution makes no mention, for example, of the First Amendment's `actual malice' standard for proving certain libels, see <i>New York Times Co.</i> v. <i>Sullivan,</i> 376 U. S. 254 (1964).. . . Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of the rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations of intermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Court evaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause. The reason is simple. Like the <i>Roe</i> framework, these <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*931</span> tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they are judge-made methods for evaluating and measuring the strength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the constitutional rights of individuals against the competing interests of government.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 548.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The second criticism is that the framework more closely resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional doctrine. Again, my answer remains the same as in <i>Webster:</i></p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[I]f this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon vast areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. . . . Are [the distinctions entailed in the trimester framework] any finer, or more `regulatory,' than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we have held that a `release time' program permitting publicschool students to leave school grounds during school hours to receive religious instruction does not violate the Establishment Clause, even though a release-time program permitting religious instruction on school grounds does violate the Clause? Compare <i>Zorach</i> v. <i>Clauson,</i> 343 U. S. 306 (1952), with <i>Illinois ex rel. Mc-</i> <i>Collum</i> v. <i>Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71,</i> <i>Champaign County,</i> 333 U. S. 203 (1948). . . . Similarly, in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban on attorney-client communication violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel, <i>Geders</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 425 U. S. 80 (1976), that right was not violated when a trial judge separated a defendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recess after the defendant's direct testimony. <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Leeke,</i> 488 U. S. 272 (1989).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations between similar circumstances does <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*932</span> not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication in favor of regulation.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 549-550.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The final, and more genuine, criticism of the trimester framework is that it fails to find the State's interest in potential human life compelling throughout pregnancy. No Member of this Court\\u00c2\\u2014nor for that matter, the Solicitor General, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\\u00c2\\u2014has ever questioned our holding in <i>Roe</i> that an abortion is not \\\\\\\"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 159. Accordingly, a State's interest in protecting fetal life is not grounded in the Constitution. Nor, consistent with our Establishment Clause, can it be a theological or sectarian interest. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring). It is, instead, a legitimate interest grounded in humanitarian or pragmatic concerns. See <i>ante,</i> at 914-915 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>But while a State has \\\\\\\"legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 846, legitimate interests are not enough. To overcome the burden of strict scrutiny, the interests must be compelling. The question then is how best to accommodate the State's interest in potential human life with the constitutional liberties of pregnant women. Again, I stand by the views I expressed in <i>Webster:</i></p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16 years ago were convinced, that the <i>Roe</i> framework, and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutional liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and accommodating the State's interest in potential human life. The viability line reflects the biological facts and truths of fetal development; it marks that threshold moment prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*933</span> woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be regarded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from, or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At the same time, the viability standard takes account of the undeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postnatal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterine environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potential human life, and in fostering a regard for human life in general, becomes compelling. As a practical matter, because viability follows `quickening'\\u00c2\\u2014the point at which a woman feels movement in her womb\\u00c2\\u2014and because viability occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it establishes an easily applicable standard for regulating abortion while providing a pregnant woman ample time to exercise her fundamental right with her responsible physician to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 492 U. S., at 553-554.<sup>[6]</sup></blockquote>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i>`s trimester framework does not ignore the State's interest in prenatal life. Like Justice Stevens, <i>ante,</i> at 916, I agree that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice \\\\\\\"is thoughtful and informed,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 872, and that \\\\\\\"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 873. But</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[s]erious questions arise . . . when a State attempts to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. <i>Ante,</i> at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to inject into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of what is best. The State may promote its preferences by funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*934</span> the individual's freedom to make such judgments.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 916 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>As the joint opinion recognizes, \\\\\\\"the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 877.</p>\\\\n<p>In sum, <i>Roe</i> `s requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be disturbed. No other approach has gained a majority, and no other is more protective of the woman's fundamental right. Lastly, no other approach properly accommodates the woman's constitutional right with the State's legitimate interests.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Application of the strict scrutiny standard results in the invalidation of all the challenged provisions. Indeed, as this Court has invalidated virtually identical provisions in prior cases, <i>stare decisis</i> requires that we again strike them down.</p>\\\\n<p>This Court has upheld informed- and written-consent requirements only where the State has demonstrated that they genuinely further important health-related state concerns. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 65-67 (1976). A State may not, under the guise of securing informed consent, \\\\\\\"require the delivery of information `designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' \\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 760, quoting <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S., at 443-444. Rigid requirements that a specific body of information be imparted to a woman in all cases, regardless of the needs of the patient, improperly intrude upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician and thereby impose an \\\\\\\"`undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket.' \\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 762, quoting <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 67, n. 8.</p>\\\\n<p>Measured against these principles, some aspects of the Pennsylvania informed-consent scheme are unconstitutional. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*935</span> While it is unobjectionable for the Commonwealth to require that the patient be informed of the nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and the probable gestational age of the unborn child, compare Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a)(i)-(iii) (1990) with <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S., at 446, n. 37, I remain unconvinced that there is a vital state need for insisting that the information be provided by a physician rather than a counselor. <i>Id.,</i> at 448. The District Court found that the physician-only requirement necessarily would increase costs to the plaintiff clinics, costs that undoubtedly would be passed on to patients. And because trained women counselors are often more understanding than physicians, and generally have more time to spend with patients, see App. 366-387, the physician-only disclosure requirement is not narrowly tailored to serve the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal health.</p>\\\\n<p>Sections 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) of the Act further requires that the physician or a qualified nonphysician inform the woman that printed materials are available from the Commonwealth that describe the fetus and provide information about medical assistance for childbirth, information about child support from the father, and a list of agencies offering adoption and other services as alternatives to abortion. <i>Thornburgh</i> invalidated biased patient-counseling requirements virtually identical to the one at issue here. What we said of those requirements fully applies in these cases:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[T]he listing of agencies in the printed Pennsylvania form presents serious problems; it contains names of agencies that well may be out of step with the needs of the particular woman and thus places the physician in an awkward position and infringes upon his or her professional responsibilities. Forcing the physician or counselor to present the materials and the list to the woman makes him or her in effect an agent of the State in treating the woman and places his or her imprimatur upon both the materials and the list. All this is, or <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*936</span> comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon the woman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks, and it officially structures\\u00c2\\u2014as it obviously was intended to do\\u00c2\\u2014the dialogue between the woman and her physician.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The requirements . . . that the woman be advised that medical assistance benefits may be available, and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in the support of the child similarly are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision. Much of this . . . , for many patients, would be irrelevant and inappropriate. For a patient with a life-threatening pregnancy, the `information' in its very rendition may be cruel as well as destructive of the physician-patient relationship. As any experienced social worker or other counselor knows, theoretical financial responsibility often does not equate with fulfillment . . . . Under the guise of informed consent, the Act requires the dissemination of information that is not relevant to such consent, and, thus, it advances no legitimate state interest.\\\\\\\" 476 U. S., at 762-763 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"This type of compelled information is the antithesis of informed consent,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 764, and goes far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to the woman's decision. \\\\\\\"That the Commonwealth does not, and surely would not, compel similar disclosure of every possible peril of necessary surgery or of simple vaccination, reveals the anti-abortion character of the statute and its real purpose.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[7]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*937</span> The 24-hour waiting period following the provision of the foregoing information is also clearly unconstitutional. The District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour delay could lead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increasing health risks, and that it would require two visits to the abortion provider, thereby increasing travel time, exposure to further harassment, and financial cost. Finally, the District Court found that the requirement would pose especially significant burdens on women living in rural areas and those women that have difficulty explaining their whereabouts. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1378-1379 (ED Pa. 1990). In <i>Akron</i> this Court invalidated a similarly arbitrary or inflexible waiting period because, as here, it furthered no legitimate state interest.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>As Justice Stevens insightfully concludes, the mandatory delay rests either on outmoded or unacceptable assumptions about the decision making capacity of women or the belief that the decision to terminate the pregnancy is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*938</span> presumptively wrong. <i>Ante,</i> at 918-919. The requirement that women consider this obvious and slanted information for an additional 24 hours contained in these provisions will only influence the woman's decision in improper ways. The vast majority of women will know this information\\u00c2\\u2014of the few that do not, it is less likely that their minds will be changed by this information than it will be either by the realization that the State opposes their choice or the need once again to endure abuse and harassment on return to the clinic.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Except in the case of a medical emergency, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3206 requires a physician to obtain the informed consent of a parent or guardian before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor or an incompetent woman. Based on evidence in the record, the District Court concluded that, in order to fulfill the informed-consent requirement, generally accepted medical principles would require an in-person visit by the parent to the facility. 744 F. Supp., at 1382. Although the Court \\\\\\\"has recognized that the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults,\\\\\\\" the State nevertheless must demonstrate that there is a \\\\\\\"<i>significant state interest</i> in conditioning an abortion . . . that is not present in the case of an adult.\\\\\\\" <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 74-75 (emphasis added). The requirement of an inperson visit would carry with it the risk of a delay of several days or possibly weeks, even where the parent is willing to consent. While the State has an interest in encouraging parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3206 is not narrowly drawn to serve that interest.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*939</span> Finally, the Pennsylvania statute requires every facility performing abortions to report its activities to the Commonwealth. Pennsylvania contends that this requirement is valid under <i>Danforth,</i> in which this Court held that recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality are permissible. <i>Id.,</i> at 79-81. The Commonwealth attempts to justify its required reports on the ground that the public has a right to know how its tax dollars are spent. A regulation designed to inform the public about public expenditures does not further the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal health. Accordingly, such a regulation cannot justify a legally significant burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>The confidential reports concerning the identities and medical judgment of physicians involved in abortions at first glance may seem valid, given the Commonwealth's interest in maternal health and enforcement of the Act. The District Court found, however, that, notwithstanding the confidentiality protections, many physicians, particularly those who have previously discontinued performing abortions because of harassment, would refuse to refer patients to abortion clinics if their names were to appear on these reports. 744 F. Supp., at 1392. The Commonwealth has failed to show that the name of the referring physician either adds to the pool of scientific knowledge concerning abortion or is reasonably related to the Commonwealth's interest in maternal health. I therefore agree with the District Court's conclusion that the confidential reporting requirements are unconstitutional <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*940</span> insofar as they require the name of the referring physician and the basis for his or her medical judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>In sum, I would affirm the judgment in No. 91-902 and reverse the judgment in No. 91-744 and remand the cases for further proceedings.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>At long last, The Chief Justice and those who have joined him admit it. Gone are the contentions that the issue need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the first page, for all to see, is what was expected: \\\\\\\"We believe that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to <i>stare decisis</i> in constitutional cases.\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 944. If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opinion today, there is far more to fear from The Chief Justice's opinion.</p>\\\\n<p>The Chief Justice's criticism of <i>Roe</i> follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple physical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personalliberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particular rights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy. <i>Post,</i> at 951. This constricted view is reinforced by The Chief Justice's exclusive reliance on tradition as a source of fundamental rights. He argues that the record in favor of a right to abortion is no stronger than the record in <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D.,</i> 491 U. S. 110 (1989), where the plurality found no fundamental right to visitation privileges by an adulterous father, or in <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Hardwick,</i> 478 U. S. 186 (1986), where the Court found no fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy, or in a case involving the \\\\\\\"`firing [of] a gun . . . into another person's body.' \\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 951-952. In The Chief Justice's world, a woman considering whether to terminate a pregnancy is entitled to no more protection than adulterers, murderers, and so-called sexual <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*941</span> deviates.<sup>[11]</sup> Given The Chief Justice's exclusive reliance on tradition, people using contraceptives seem the next likely candidate for his list of outcasts.</p>\\\\n<p>Even more shocking than The Chief Justice's cramped notion of individual liberty is his complete omission of any discussion of the effects that compelled childbirth and motherhood have on women's lives. The only expression of concern with women's health is purely instrumental\\u00c2\\u2014for The Chief Justice, only women's <i>psychological</i> health is a concern, and only to the extent that he assumes that every woman who decides to have an abortion does so without serious consideration of the moral implications of her decision. <i>Post,</i> at 967-968. In short, The Chief Justice's view of the State's compelling interest in maternal health has less to do with health than it does with compelling women to be maternal.</p>\\\\n<p>Nor does The Chief Justice give any serious consideration to the doctrine of <i>stare decisis.</i> For The Chief Justice, the facts that gave rise to <i>Roe</i> are surprisingly simple: \\\\\\\"women become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, and women give birth to children.\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 955. This characterization of the issue thus allows The Chief Justice quickly to discard the joint opinion's reliance argument by asserting that \\\\\\\"reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of\\\\\\\" a decision overruling <i>Roe. Post,</i> at 956 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>The Chief Justice's narrow conception of individual liberty and <i>stare decisis</i> leads him to propose the same standard of review proposed by the plurality in <i>Webster.</i> \\\\\\\"States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.,</i> 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645, 651-653 (1972).\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 966. The <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*942</span> Chief Justice then further weakens the test by providing an insurmountable requirement for facial challenges: Petitioners must \\\\\\\"`show that no set of circumstances exists under which the [provision] would be valid.' \\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 973, quoting <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S., at 514. In short, in his view, petitioners must prove that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to <i>anyone.</i> Finally, in applying his standard to the spousal-notification provision, The Chief Justice contends that the record lacks any \\\\\\\"hard evidence\\\\\\\" to support the joint opinion's contention that a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of women who prefer not to notify their husbands involve situations of battered women and unreported spousal assault. <i>Post,</i> at 974, n. 2. Yet throughout the explication of his standard, The Chief Justice never explains what hard evidence is, how large a fraction is required, or how a battered woman is supposed to pursue an as-applied challenge.</p>\\\\n<p>Under his standard, States can ban abortion if that ban is rationally related to a legitimate state interest\\u00c2\\u2014a standard which the United States calls \\\\\\\"deferential, but not toothless.\\\\\\\" Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe the teeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General could offer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminal penalties, <i>with no exception for the life of the mother,</i> \\\\\\\"could raise very serious questions.\\\\\\\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Perhaps, the Solicitor General offered, the failure to include an exemption for the life of the mother would be \\\\\\\"arbitrary and capricious.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 49. If, as The Chief Justice contends, the undue burden test is made out of whole cloth, the so-called \\\\\\\"arbitrary and capricious\\\\\\\" limit is the Solicitor General's \\\\\\\"new clothes.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>Even if it is somehow \\\\\\\"irrational\\\\\\\" for a State to require a woman to risk her life for her child, what protection is offered for women who become pregnant through rape or incest? Is there anything arbitrary or capricious about a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*943</span> State's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visited upon his offspring?<sup>[12]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>But, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties. Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballot box.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>In one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart from that of The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia. And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approaches is short\\u00c2\\u2014the distance is but a single vote.</p>\\\\n<p>I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*944</span> Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion, following its newly minted variation on <i>stare decisis,</i> retains the outer shell of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case. We believe that <i>Roe</i> was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to <i>stare decisis</i> in constitutional cases. We would adopt the approach of the plurality in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989), and uphold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute in their entirety.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>In ruling on this litigation below, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit first observed that \\\\\\\"this appeal does not directly implicate <i>Roe;</i> this case involves the regulation of abortions rather than their outright prohibition.\\\\\\\" 947 F. 2d 682, 687 (1991). Accordingly, the court directed its attention to the question of the standard of review for abortion regulations. In attempting to settle on the correct standard, however, the court confronted the confused state of this Court's abortion jurisprudence. After considering the several opinions in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services, supra</i><i>,</i> and <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S. 417 (1990), the Court of Appeals concluded that Justice O'Connor's \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" test was controlling, as that was the narrowest ground on which we had upheld recent abortion regulations. 947 F. 2d, at 693-697 (\\\\\\\"When a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds\\\\\\\" (quoting <i>Marks</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Applying this standard, the Court of Appeals upheld all of the challenged regulations except the one <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*945</span> requiring a woman to notify her spouse of an intended abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>In arguing that this Court should invalidate each of the provisions at issue, petitioners insist that we reaffirm our decision in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i><i>,</i> in which we held unconstitutional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure an abortion except to save the life of the mother.<sup>[1]</sup> We agree with the Court of Appeals that our decision in <i>Roe</i> is not directly implicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which does not prohibit, but simply regulates, abortion. But, as the Court of Appeals found, the state of our post-<i>Roe</i> decisional law dealing with the regulation of abortion is confusing and uncertain, indicating that a reexamination of that line of cases is in order. Unfortunately for those who must apply this Court's decisions, the reexamination undertaken today leaves the Court no less divided than beforehand. Although they reject the trimester framework that formed the underpinning of <i>Roe,</i> Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter adopt a revised undue burden standard to analyze the challenged regulations. We conclude, however, that such an outcome is an unjustified constitutional compromise, one which leaves the Court in a position to closely scrutinize all types of abortion regulations despite the fact that it lacks the power to do so under the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe,</i> the Court opined that the State \\\\\\\"does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, . . . and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*946</span> the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 162 (emphasis omitted). In the companion case of <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973), the Court referred to its conclusion in <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"that a pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutional right to an abortion on her demand.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 189. But while the language and holdings of these cases appeared to leave States free to regulate abortion procedures in a variety of ways, later decisions based on them have found considerably less latitude for such regulations than might have been expected.</p>\\\\n<p>For example, after <i>Roe,</i> many States have sought to protect their young citizens by requiring that a minor seeking an abortion involve her parents in the decision. Some States have simply required notification of the parents, while others have required a minor to obtain the consent of her parents. In a number of decisions, however, the Court has substantially limited the States in their ability to impose such requirements. With regard to parental <i>notice</i> requirements, we initially held that a State could require a minor to notify her parents before proceeding with an abortion. <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S. 398, 407-410 (1981). Recently, however, we indicated that a State's ability to impose a notice requirement actually depends on whether it requires notice of one or both parents. We concluded that although the Constitution might allow a State to demand that notice be given to one parent prior to an abortion, it may not require that similar notice be given to <i>two</i> parents, unless the State incorporates a judicial bypass procedure in that two-parent requirement. <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota, supra</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p>We have treated parental <i>consent</i> provisions even more harshly. Three years after <i>Roe,</i> we invalidated a Missouri regulation requiring that an unmarried woman under the age of 18 obtain the consent of one of her parents before proceeding with an abortion. We held that our abortion jurisprudence prohibited the State from imposing such a \\\\\\\"blanket provision. . . requiring the consent of a parent.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*947</span> <i>of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976). In <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (1979), the Court struck down a similar Massachusetts parental consent statute. A majority of the Court indicated, however, that a State could constitutionally require parental consent, if it alternatively allowed a pregnant minor to obtain an abortion without parental consent by showing either that she was mature enough to make her own decision, or that the abortion would be in her best interests. See <i>id.,</i> at 643-644 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 656-657 (White, J., dissenting). In light of <i>Bellotti,</i> we have upheld one parental consent regulation which incorporated a judicial bypass option we viewed as sufficient, see <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983), but have invalidated another because of our belief that the judicial procedure did not satisfy the dictates of <i>Bellotti,</i> see <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 439-442 (1983). We have never had occasion, as we have in the parental notice context, to further parse our parental consent jurisprudence into oneparent and two-parent components.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe,</i> the Court observed that certain States recognized the right of the father to participate in the abortion decision in certain circumstances. Because neither <i>Roe</i> nor <i>Doe</i> involved the assertion of any paternal right, the Court expressly stated that the case did not disturb the validity of regulations that protected such a right. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 165, n. 67. But three years later, in <i>Danforth,</i> the Court extended its abortion jurisprudence and held that a State could not require that a woman obtain the consent of her spouse before proceeding with an abortion. <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 69-71.</p>\\\\n<p>States have also regularly tried to ensure that a woman's decision to have an abortion is an informed and wellconsidered one. In <i>Danforth,</i> we upheld a requirement that a woman sign a consent form prior to her abortion, and observed that \\\\\\\"it is desirable and imperative that [the decision] <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*948</span> be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67. Since that case, however, we have twice invalidated state statutes designed to impart such knowledge to a woman seeking an abortion. In <i>Akron,</i> we held unconstitutional a regulation requiring a physician to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the status of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the complications that could result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies providing assistance and information with respect to adoption and childbirth. <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra,</i> at 442-445. More recently, in <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747 (1986), we struck down a more limited Pennsylvania regulation requiring that a woman be informed of the risks associated with the abortion procedure and the assistance available to her if she decided to proceed with her pregnancy, because we saw the compelled information as \\\\\\\"the antithesis of informed consent.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 764. Even when a State has sought only to provide information that, in our view, was consistent with the <i>Roe</i> framework, we concluded that the State could not require that a physician furnish the information, but instead had to alternatively allow nonphysician counselors to provide it. <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 462 U. S., at 448-449. In <i>Akron</i> as well, we went further and held that a State may not require a physician to wait 24 hours to perform an abortion after receiving the consent of a woman. Although the State sought to ensure that the woman's decision was carefully considered, the Court concluded that the Constitution forbade the State to impose any sort of delay. <i>Id.,</i> at 449-451.</p>\\\\n<p>We have not allowed States much leeway to regulate even the actual abortion procedure. Although a State can require that second-trimester abortions be performed in outpatient clinics, see <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 462 U. S. 506 (1983), we concluded in <i>Akron</i> and <i>Ashcroft</i> that a State could not <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*949</span> require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals. See <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra,</i> at 437-439; <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft, supra,</i> at 481-482. Despite the fact that <i>Roe</i> expressly allowed regulation after the first trimester in furtherance of maternal health, \\\\\\\"`present medical knowledge,' \\\\\\\" in our view, could not justify such a hospitalization requirement under the trimester framework. <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra,</i> at 437 (quoting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 163). And in <i>Danforth,</i> the Court held that Missouri could not outlaw the saline amniocentesis method of abortion, concluding that the Missouri Legislature had \\\\\\\"failed to appreciate and to consider several significant facts\\\\\\\" in making its decision. 428 U. S., at 77.</p>\\\\n<p>Although <i>Roe</i> allowed state regulation after the point of viability to protect the potential life of the fetus, the Court subsequently rejected attempts to regulate in this manner. In <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379 (1979), the Court struck down a statute that governed the determination of viability. <i>Id.,</i> at 390-397. In the process, we made clear that the trimester framework incorporated only one definition of viability\\u00c2\\u2014ours\\u00c2\\u2014as we forbade States to decide that a certain objective indicator\\u00c2\\u2014\\\\\\\"be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014should govern the definition of viability. <i>Id.,</i> at 389. In that same case, we also invalidated a regulation requiring a physician to use the abortion technique offering the best chance for fetal survival when performing postviability abortions. See <i>id.,</i> at 397-401; see also <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 768-769 (invalidating a similar regulation). In <i>Thornburgh,</i> the Court struck down Pennsylvania's requirement that a second physician be present at post viability abortions to help preserve the health of the unborn child, on the ground that it did not incorporate a sufficient medical emergency exception. <i>Id.,</i> at 769-771. Regulations governing the treatment of aborted fetuses have <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*950</span> met a similar fate. In <i>Akron,</i> we invalidated a provision requiring physicians performing abortions to \\\\\\\"insure that the remains of the unborn child are disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner.\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>Dissents in these cases expressed the view that the Court was expanding upon <i>Roe</i> in imposing ever greater restrictions on the States. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"The extent to which the Court has departed from the limitations expressed in <i>Roe</i> is readily apparent\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 814 (White, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"[T]he majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"). And, when confronted with state regulations of this type in past years, the Court has become increasingly more divided: The three most recent abortion cases have not commanded a Court opinion. See <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S. 502 (1990); <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S. 417 (1990); <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989).</p>\\\\n<p>The task of the Court of Appeals in the present cases was obviously complicated by this confusion and uncertainty. Following <i>Marks</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 430 U. S. 188 (1977), it concluded that in light of <i>Webster</i> and <i>Hodgson,</i> the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in <i>Roe</i> was no longer applicable, and that the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard adopted by Justice O'Connor was the governing principle. This state of confusion and disagreement warrants reexamination of the \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" accorded to a woman's decision to abort a fetus in <i>Roe,</i> with its concomitant requirement that any state regulation of abortion survive \\\\\\\"strict scrutiny.\\\\\\\" See <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 501 U. S. 808, 827-828 (1991) (observing that reexamination of constitutional decisions is appropriate when those decisions have generated uncertainty and failed to provide clear guidance, because \\\\\\\"correction through legislative <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*951</span> action is practically impossible\\\\\\\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 546-547, 557 (1985).</p>\\\\n<p>We have held that a liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will be deemed fundamental if it is \\\\\\\"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\\\\\\\" <i>Palko</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937). Three years earlier, in <i>Snyder</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 291 U. S. 97 (1934), we referred to a \\\\\\\"principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 105; see also <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D.,</i> 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion) (citing the language from <i>Snyder</i>). These expressions are admittedly not precise, but our decisions implementing this notion of \\\\\\\"fundamental\\\\\\\" rights do not afford any more elaborate basis on which to base such a classification.</p>\\\\n<p>In construing the phrase \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have recognized that its meaning extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. In <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510 (1925), we held that it included a parent's right to send a child to private school; in <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S. 390 (1923), we held that it included a right to teach a foreign language in a parochial school. Building on these cases, we have held that the term \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" includes a right to marry, <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967); a right to procreate, <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and a right to use contraceptives, <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965); <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438 (1972). But a reading of these opinions makes clear that they do not endorse any all-encompassing \\\\\\\"right of privacy.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> the Court recognized a \\\\\\\"guarantee of personal privacy\\\\\\\" which \\\\\\\"is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 152-153. We are now of the view that, in terming this right fundamental, the Court in <i>Roe</i> read the earlier <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*952</span> opinions upon which it based its decision much too broadly. Unlike marriage, procreation, and contraception, abortion \\\\\\\"involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.\\\\\\\" <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 325 (1980). The abortion decision must therefore \\\\\\\"be recognized as <i>sui generis,</i> different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra,</i> at 792 (White, J., dissenting). One cannot ignore the fact that a woman is not isolated in her pregnancy, and that the decision to abort necessarily involves the destruction of a fetus. See <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D., supra,</i> at 124, n. 4 (To look \\\\\\\"at the act which is assertedly the subject of a liberty interest in isolation from its effect upon other people [is] like inquiring whether there is a liberty interest in firing a gun where the case at hand happens to involve its discharge into another person's body\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Nor do the historical traditions of the American people support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancy is \\\\\\\"fundamental.\\\\\\\" The common law which we inherited from England made abortion after \\\\\\\"quickening\\\\\\\" an offense. At the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, statutory prohibitions or restrictions on abortion were commonplace; in 1868, at least 28 of the then-37 States and 8 Territories had statutes banning or limiting abortion. J. Mohr, Abortion in America 200 (1978). By the turn of the century virtually every State had a law prohibiting or restricting abortion on its books. By the middle of the present century, a liberalization trend had set in. But 21 of the restrictive abortion laws in effect in 1868 were still in effect in 1973 when <i>Roe</i> was decided, and an overwhelming majority of the States prohibited abortion unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 139-140; <i>id.,</i> at 176-177, n. 2 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). On this record, it can scarcely be said that any deeply rooted tradition of relatively unrestricted abortion in our history <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*953</span> supported the classification of the right to abortion as \\\\\\\"fundamental\\\\\\\" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\\\\n<p>We think, therefore, both in view of this history and of our decided cases dealing with substantive liberty under the Due Process Clause, that the Court was mistaken in <i>Roe</i> when it classified a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy as a \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" that could be abridged only in a manner which withstood \\\\\\\"strict scrutiny.\\\\\\\" In so concluding, we repeat the observation made in <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Hardwick,</i> 478 U. S. 186 (1986):</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Nor are we inclined to take a more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause. The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 194.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>We believe that the sort of constitutionally imposed abortion code of the type illustrated by our decisions following <i>Roe</i> is inconsistent \\\\\\\"with the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does.\\\\\\\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S., at 518 (plurality opinion). The Court in <i>Roe</i> reached too far when it analogized the right to abort a fetus to the rights involved in <i>Pierce, Meyer, Loving,</i> and <i>Griswold,</i> and thereby deemed the right to abortion fundamental.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter cannot bring itself to say that <i>Roe</i> was correct as an original matter, but the authors are of the view that \\\\\\\"the immediate question is not the soundness of <i>Roe</i> `s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 871. Instead of claiming that <i>Roe</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*954</span> was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpretation, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion of <i>stare decisis.</i> This discussion of the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> appears to be almost entirely dicta, because the joint opinion does not apply that principle in dealing with <i>Roe. Roe</i> decided that a woman had a fundamental right to an abortion. The joint opinion rejects that view. <i>Roe</i> decided that abortion regulations were to be subjected to \\\\\\\"strict scrutiny\\\\\\\" and could be justified only in the light of \\\\\\\"compelling state interests.\\\\\\\" The joint opinion rejects that view. <i>Ante,</i> at 872-873; see <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 162-164. <i>Roe</i> analyzed abortion regulation under a rigid trimester framework, a framework which has guided this Court's decision making for 19 years. The joint opinion rejects that framework. <i>Ante,</i> at 873.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as meaning \\\\\\\"to abide by, or adhere to, decided cases.\\\\\\\" Black's Law Dictionary 1406 (6th ed. 1990). Whatever the \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\" of <i>Roe</i> that is left after the joint opinion finishes dissecting it is surely not the result of that principle. While purporting to adhere to precedent, the joint opinion instead revises it. <i>Roe</i> continues to exist, but only in the way a storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to give the illusion of reality. Decisions following <i>Roe,</i> such as <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747 (1986), are frankly overruled in part under the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard expounded in the joint opinion. <i>Ante,</i> at 881-884.</p>\\\\n<p>In our view, authentic principles of <i>stare decisis</i> do not require that any portion of the reasoning in <i>Roe</i> be kept intact. \\\\\\\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is not . . . a universal, inexorable command,\\\\\\\" especially in cases involving the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Erroneous decisions in such constitutional cases are uniquely durable, because correction through legislative action, save for <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*955</span> constitutional amendment, is impossible. It is therefore our duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that \\\\\\\"depar[t] from a proper understanding\\\\\\\" of the Constitution. <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S., at 557; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978) (\\\\\\\"`[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, . . . [t]he Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function'\\\\\\\" (quoting <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., supra,</i> at 406-408 (Brandeis, J., dissenting))); <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Allwright,</i> 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944). Our constitutional watch does not cease merely because we have spoken before on an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutional interpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine the question. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943); <i>Erie R. Co.</i> v. <i>Tompkins,</i> 304 U. S. 64, 74-78 (1938).</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion discusses several <i>stare decisis</i> factors which, it asserts, point toward retaining a portion of <i>Roe.</i> Two of these factors are that the main \\\\\\\"factual underpinning\\\\\\\" of <i>Roe</i> has remained the same, and that its doctrinal foundation is no weaker now than it was in 1973. <i>Ante,</i> at 857-860. Of course, what might be called the basic facts which gave rise to <i>Roe</i> have remained the same\\u00c2\\u2014women become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, and women give birth to children. But this is only to say that the same facts which gave rise to <i>Roe</i> will continue to give rise to similar cases. It is not a reason, in and of itself, why those cases must be decided in the same incorrect manner as was the first case to deal with the question. And surely there is no requirement, in considering whether to depart from <i>stare decisis</i> in a constitutional case, that a decision be more wrong now than it was at the time it was rendered. If that were true, the most outlandish constitutional decision could survive <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*956</span> forever, based simply on the fact that it was no more outlandish later than it was when originally rendered.</p>\\\\n<p>Nor does the joint opinion faithfully follow this alleged requirement. The opinion frankly concludes that <i>Roe</i> and its progeny were wrong in failing to recognize that the State's interests in maternal health and in the protection of unborn human life exist throughout pregnancy. <i>Ante,</i> at 871-873. But there is no indication that these components of <i>Roe</i> are any more incorrect at this juncture than they were at its inception.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion also points to the reliance interests involved in this context in its effort to explain why precedent must be followed for precedent's sake. Certainly it is true that where reliance is truly at issue, as in the case of judicial decisions that have formed the basis for private decisions, \\\\\\\"[c]onsiderations in favor of <i>stare decisis</i> are at their acme.\\\\\\\" <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee,</i> 501 U. S., at 828. But, as the joint opinion apparently agrees, <i>ante,</i> at 855-856, any traditional notion of reliance is not applicable here. The Court today cuts back on the protection afforded by <i>Roe,</i> and no one claims that this action defeats any reliance interest in the disavowed trimester framework. Similarly, reliance interests would not be diminished were the Court to go further and acknowledge the full error of <i>Roe,</i> as \\\\\\\"reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of\\\\\\\" this action. <i>Ante,</i> at 856.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion thus turns to what can only be described as an unconventional\\u00c2\\u2014and unconvincing\\u00c2\\u2014notion of reliance, a view based on the surmise that the availability of abortion since <i>Roe</i> has led to \\\\\\\"two decades of economic and social developments\\\\\\\" that would be undercut if the error of <i>Roe</i> were recognized. <i>Ante,</i> at 856. The joint opinion's assertion of this fact is undeveloped and totally conclusory. In fact, one cannot be sure to what economic and social developments the opinion is referring. Surely it is dubious to suggest that women have reached their \\\\\\\"places in society\\\\\\\" in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*957</span> reliance upon <i>Roe,</i> rather than as a result of their determination to obtain higher education and compete with men in the job market, and of society's increasing recognition of their ability to fill positions that were previously thought to be reserved only for men. <i>Ante,</i> at 856.</p>\\\\n<p>In the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to prove any true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solely on generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a belief that the people of this country have grown accustomed to the <i>Roe</i> decision over the last 19 years and have \\\\\\\"ordered their thinking and living around\\\\\\\" it. <i>Ante,</i> at 856. As an initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion can view the \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\" of <i>Roe</i> as so deeply rooted in our constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and disposes of that same decision's trimester framework. Furthermore, at various points in the past, the same could have been said about this Court's erroneous decisions that the Constitution allowed \\\\\\\"separate but equal\\\\\\\" treatment of minorities, see <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537 (1896), or that \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" under the Due Process Clause protected \\\\\\\"freedom of contract,\\\\\\\" see <i>Adkins</i> v. <i>Children's Hospital of District of Columbia,</i> 261 U. S. 525 (1923); <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The \\\\\\\"separate but equal\\\\\\\" doctrine lasted 58 years after <i>Plessy,</i> and <i>Lochner</i> `s protection of contractual freedom lasted 32 years. However, the simple fact that a generation or more had grown used to these major decisions did not prevent the Court from correcting its errors in those cases, nor should it prevent us from correctly interpreting the Constitution here. See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (rejecting the \\\\\\\"separate but equal\\\\\\\" doctrine); <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Parrish,</i> 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling <i>Adkins</i> v. <i>Children's Hospital, supra,</i> in upholding Washington's minimum wage law).</p>\\\\n<p>Apparently realizing that conventional <i>stare decisis</i> principles do not support its position, the joint opinion advances a belief that retaining a portion of <i>Roe</i> is necessary to protect <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*958</span> the \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" of this Court. <i>Ante,</i> at 861-869. Because the Court must take care to render decisions \\\\\\\"grounded truly in principle,\\\\\\\" and not simply as political and social compromises, <i>ante,</i> at 865, the joint opinion properly declares it to be this Court's duty to ignore the public criticism and protest that may arise as a result of a decision. Few would quarrel with this statement, although it may be doubted that Members of this Court, holding their tenure as they do during constitutional \\\\\\\"good behavior,\\\\\\\" are at all likely to be intimidated by such public protests.</p>\\\\n<p>But the joint opinion goes on to state that when the Court \\\\\\\"resolve[s] the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in <i>Roe</i> and those rare, comparable cases,\\\\\\\" its decision is exempt from reconsideration under established principles of <i>stare decisis</i> in constitutional cases. <i>Ante,</i> at 866. This is so, the joint opinion contends, because in those \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" cases the Court has \\\\\\\"call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\\\\\\\" and must therefore take special care not to be perceived as \\\\\\\"surrender[ing] to political pressure\\\\\\\" and continued opposition. <i>Ante,</i> at 866, 867. This is a truly novel principle, one which is contrary to both the Court's historical practice and to the Court's traditional willingness to tolerate criticism of its opinions. Under this principle, when the Court has ruled on a divisive issue, it is apparently prevented from overruling that decision for the sole reason that it was incorrect, <i>unless opposition to the original decision has died away.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The first difficulty with this principle lies in its assumption that cases that are \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" can be readily distinguished from those that are not. The question of whether a particular issue is \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" enough to qualify for special protection is entirely subjective and dependent on the individual assumptions of the Members of this Court. In addition, because the Court's duty is to ignore public opinion and criticism on issues that come before it, its Members are <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*959</span> in perhaps the worst position to judge whether a decision divides the Nation deeply enough to justify such uncommon protection. Although many of the Court's decisions divide the populace to a large degree, we have not previously on that account shied away from applying normal rules of <i>stare decisis</i> when urged to reconsider earlier decisions. Over the past 21 years, for example, the Court has overruled in whole or in part 34 of its previous constitutional decisions. See <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee, supra,</i> at 828-830, and n. 1 (listing cases).</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion picks out and discusses two prior Court rulings that it believes are of the \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" variety, and concludes that they are of comparable dimension to <i>Roe. Ante,</i> at 861-864 (discussing <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York, supra</i><i>,</i> and <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson, supra</i> ). It appears to us very odd indeed that the joint opinion chooses as benchmarks two cases in which the Court chose <i>not</i> to adhere to erroneous constitutional precedent, but instead enhanced its stature by acknowledging and correcting its error, apparently in violation of the joint opinion's \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" principle. See <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Parrish, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education, supra</i><i>.</i> One might also wonder how it is that the joint opinion puts these, and not others, in the \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" category, and how it assumes that these are the only two lines of cases of comparable dimension to <i>Roe.</i> There is no reason to think that either <i>Plessy</i> or <i>Lochner</i> produced the sort of public protest when they were decided that <i>Roe</i> did. There were undoubtedly large segments of the bench and bar who agreed with the dissenting views in those cases, but surely that cannot be what the Court means when it uses the term \\\\\\\"intensely divisive,\\\\\\\" or many other cases would have to be added to the list. In terms of public protest, however, <i>Roe,</i> so far as we know, was unique. But just as the Court should not respond to that sort of protest by retreating from the decision simply to allay the concerns of the protesters, it should likewise not respond by determining to adhere to the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*960</span> decision at all costs lest it <i>seem</i> to be retreating under fire. Public protests should not alter the normal application of <i>stare decisis,</i> lest perfectly lawful protest activity be penalized by the Court itself.</p>\\\\n<p>Taking the joint opinion on its own terms, we doubt that its distinction between <i>Roe,</i> on the one hand, and <i>Plessy</i> and <i>Lochner,</i> on the other, withstands analysis. The joint opinion acknowledges that the Court improved its stature by overruling <i>Plessy</i> in <i>Brown</i> on a deeply divisive issue. And our decision in <i>West Coast Hotel,</i> which overruled <i>Adkins</i> v. <i>Children's Hospital, supra,</i> and <i>Lochner,</i> was rendered at a time when Congress was considering President Franklin Roosevelt's proposal to \\\\\\\"reorganize\\\\\\\" this Court and enable him to name six additional Justices in the event that any Member of the Court over the age of 70 did not elect to retire. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which the Court would face more intense opposition to a prior ruling than it did at that time, and, under the general principle proclaimed in the joint opinion, the Court seemingly should have responded to this opposition by stubbornly refusing to reexamine the <i>Lochner</i> rationale, lest it lose legitimacy by appearing to \\\\\\\"overrule under fire.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 867.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion agrees that the Court's stature would have been seriously damaged if in <i>Brown</i> and <i>West Coast Hotel</i> it had dug in its heels and refused to apply normal principles of <i>stare decisis</i> to the earlier decisions. But the opinion contends that the Court was entitled to overrule <i>Plessy</i> and <i>Lochner</i> in those cases, despite the existence of opposition to the original decisions, only because both the Nation and the Court had learned new lessons in the interim. This is at best a feebly supported, <i>post hoc</i> rationalization for those decisions.</p>\\\\n<p>For example, the opinion asserts that the Court could justifiably overrule its decision in <i>Lochner</i> only because the Depression had convinced \\\\\\\"most people\\\\\\\" that constitutional protection of contractual freedom contributed to an economy <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*961</span> that failed to protect the welfare of all. <i>Ante,</i> at 861. Surely the joint opinion does not mean to suggest that people saw this Court's failure to uphold minimum wage statutes as the cause of the Great Depression! In any event, the <i>Lochner</i> Court did not base its rule upon the policy judgment that an unregulated market was fundamental to a stable economy; it simple believed, erroneously, that \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" under the Due Process Clause protected the \\\\\\\"right to make a contract.\\\\\\\" <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 198 U. S., at 53. Nor is it the case that the people of this Nation only discovered the dangers of extreme laissez-faire economics because of the Depression. State laws regulating maximum hours and minimum wages were in existence well before that time. A Utah statute of that sort enacted in 1896 was involved in our decision in <i>Holden</i> v. <i>Hardy,</i> 169 U. S. 366 (1898), and other States followed suit shortly afterwards, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Muller</i> v. <i>Oregon,</i> 208 U. S. 412 (1908); <i>Bunting</i> v. <i>Oregon,</i> 243 U. S. 426 (1917). These statutes were indeed enacted because of a belief on the part of their sponsors that \\\\\\\"freedom of contract\\\\\\\" did not protect the welfare of workers, demonstrating that that belief manifested itself more than a generation before the Great Depression. Whether \\\\\\\"most people\\\\\\\" had come to share it in the hard times of the 1930's is, insofar as anything the joint opinion advances, entirely speculative. The crucial failing at that time was not that workers were not paid a fair wage, but that there was no work available at <i>any</i> wage.</p>\\\\n<p>When the Court finally recognized its error in <i>West Coast Hotel,</i> it did not engage in the <i>post hoc</i> rationalization that the joint opinion attributes to it today; it did not state that <i>Lochner</i> had been based on an economic view that had fallen into disfavor, and that it therefore should be overruled. Chief Justice Hughes in his opinion for the Court simply recognized what Justice Holmes had previously recognized in his <i>Lochner</i> dissent, that \\\\\\\"[t]he Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.\\\\\\\" <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Parrish,</i> 300 U. S., at 391; <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York, supra,</i> at 75 (Holmes, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*962</span> J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"[A] constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of <i>laissez faire</i> \\\\\\\"). Although the Court did acknowledge in the last paragraph of its opinion the state of affairs during the thencurrent Depression, the theme of the opinion is that the Court had been mistaken as a matter of constitutional law when it embraced \\\\\\\"freedom of contract\\\\\\\" 32 years previously.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion also agrees that the Court acted properly in rejecting the doctrine of \\\\\\\"separate but equal\\\\\\\" in <i>Brown.</i> In fact, the opinion lauds <i>Brown</i> in comparing it to <i>Roe. Ante,</i> at 867. This is strange, in that under the opinion's \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" principle the Court would seemingly have been forced to adhere to its erroneous decision in <i>Plessy</i> because of its \\\\\\\"intensely divisive\\\\\\\" character. To us, adherence to <i>Roe</i> today under the guise of \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" would seem to resemble more closely adherence to <i>Plessy</i> on the same ground. Fortunately, the Court did not choose that option in <i>Brown,</i> and instead frankly repudiated <i>Plessy.</i> The joint opinion concludes that such repudiation was justified only because of newly discovered evidence that segregation had the effect of treating one race as inferior to another. But it can hardly be argued that this was not urged upon those who decided <i>Plessy,</i> as Justice Harlan observed in his dissent that the law at issue \\\\\\\"puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow-citizens, our equals before the law.\\\\\\\" <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S., at 562. It is clear that the same arguments made before the Court in <i>Brown</i> were made in <i>Plessy</i> as well. The Court in <i>Brown</i> simply recognized, as Justice Harlan had recognized beforehand, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit racial segregation. The rule of <i>Brown</i> is not tied to popular opinion about the evils of segregation; it is a judgment that the Equal Protection Clause does not permit racial segregation, no matter whether the public might come to believe that it is beneficial. On that ground it stands, and on that ground <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*963</span> alone the Court was justified in properly concluding that the <i>Plessy</i> Court had erred.</p>\\\\n<p>There is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that the propriety of overruling a \\\\\\\"divisive\\\\\\\" decision depends in part on whether \\\\\\\"most people\\\\\\\" would now agree that it should be overruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progression to substantial popular agreement apparently is required to allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. How such agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opinion poll, the joint opinion does not say. But surely even the suggestion is totally at war with the idea of \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" in whose name it is invoked. The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.</p>\\\\n<p>There are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that the Court is perceived as \\\\\\\"surrender[ing] to political pressure\\\\\\\" when it overrules a controversial decision, <i>ante,</i> at 867, the joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any controversy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect its legitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a controversial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who oppose the decision. But a decision to <i>adhere</i> to prior precedent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case one can easily argue that the Court is responding to those who have demonstrated in favor of the original decision. The decision in <i>Roe</i> has engendered large demonstrations, including repeated marches on this Court and on Congress, both in opposition to and in support of that opinion. A decision either way on <i>Roe</i> can therefore be perceived as favoring one group or the other. But this perceived dilemma arises only if one assumes, as the joint opinion does, that the Court <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*964</span> should make its decisions with a view toward speculative public perceptions. If one assumes instead, as the Court surely did in both <i>Brown</i> and <i>West Coast Hotel,</i> that the Court's legitimacy is enhanced by faithful interpretation of the Constitution irrespective of public opposition, such selfengendered difficulties may be put to one side.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> is not this Court's only decision to generate conflict. Our decisions in some recent capital cases, and in <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Hardwick,</i> 478 U. S. 186 (1986), have also engendered demonstrations in opposition. The joint opinion's message to such protesters appears to be that they must cease their activities in order to serve their cause, because their protests will only cement in place a decision which by normal standards of <i>stare decisis</i> should be reconsidered. Nearly a century ago, Justice David J. Brewer of this Court, in an article discussing criticism of its decisions, observed that \\\\\\\"many criticisms may be, like their authors, devoid of good taste, but better all sorts of criticism than no criticism at all.\\\\\\\" Justice Brewer on \\\\\\\"The Nation's Anchor,\\\\\\\" 57 Albany L. J. 166, 169 (1898). This was good advice to the Court then, as it is today. Strong and often misguided criticism of a decision should not render the decision immune from reconsideration, lest a fetish for legitimacy penalize freedom of expression.</p>\\\\n<p>The end result of the joint opinion's paeans of praise for legitimacy is the enunciation of a brand new standard for evaluating state regulation of a woman's right to abortion\\u00c2\\u2014 the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard. As indicated above, <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> adopted a \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" standard under which state regulations could survive only if they met the requirement of \\\\\\\"strict scrutiny.\\\\\\\" While we disagree with that standard, it at least had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time <i>Roe</i> was decided. The same cannot be said for the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard, which is created largely out of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion. It is a standard which even today does not command the support of a majority of this Court. And it will not, we believe, result <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*965</span> in the sort of \\\\\\\"simple limitation,\\\\\\\" easily applied, which the joint opinion anticipates. <i>Ante,</i> at 855. In sum, it is a standard which is not built to last.</p>\\\\n<p>In evaluating abortion regulations under that standard, judges will have to decide whether they place a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. <i>Ante,</i> at 877. In that this standard is based even more on a judge's subjective determinations than was the trimester framework, the standard will do nothing to prevent \\\\\\\"judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field\\\\\\\" guided only by their personal views. <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S., at 502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). Because the undue burden standard is plucked from nowhere, the question of what is a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" to abortion will undoubtedly engender a variety of conflicting views. For example, in the very matter before us now, the authors of the joint opinion would uphold Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period, concluding that a \\\\\\\"particular burden\\\\\\\" on some women is not a substantial obstacle. <i>Ante,</i> at 887. But the authors would at the same time strike down Pennsylvania's spousal notice provision, after finding that in a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of cases the provision will be a substantial obstacle. <i>Ante,</i> at 895. And, while the authors conclude that the informed consent provisions do not constitute an \\\\\\\"undue burden,\\\\\\\" Justice Stevens would hold that they do. <i>Ante,</i> at 920-922.</p>\\\\n<p>Furthermore, while striking down the spousal <i>notice</i> regulation, the joint opinion would uphold a parental <i>consent</i> restriction that certainly places very substantial obstacles in the path of a minor's abortion choice. The joint opinion is forthright in admitting that it draws this distinction based on a policy judgment that parents will have the best interests of their children at heart, while the same is not necessarily true of husbands as to their wives. <i>Ante,</i> at 895. This may or may not be a correct judgment, but it is quintessentially a legislative one. The \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" inquiry does not in any way supply the distinction between parental consent and <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*966</span> spousal consent which the joint opinion adopts. Despite the efforts of the joint opinion, the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework which it discards today. Under the guise of the Constitution, this Court will still impart its own preferences on the States in the form of a complex abortion code.</p>\\\\n<p>The sum of the joint opinion's labors in the name of <i>stare decisis</i> and \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" is this: <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin Village, which may be pointed out to passers-by as a monument to the importance of adhering to precedent. But behind the facade, an entirely new method of analysis, without any roots in constitutional law, is imported to decide the constitutionality of state laws regulating abortion. Neither <i>stare decisis</i> nor \\\\\\\"legitimacy\\\\\\\" are truly served by such an effort.</p>\\\\n<p>We have stated above our belief that the Constitution does not subject state abortion regulations to heightened scrutiny. Accordingly, we think that the correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in <i>Webster.</i> A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.,</i> 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645, 651-653 (1972). With this rule in mind, we examine each of the challenged provisions.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 3205 of the Act imposes certain requirements related to the informed consent of a woman seeking an abortion. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205 (1990). Section 3205(a)(1) requires that the referring or performing physician must inform a woman contemplating an abortion of (i) the nature of the procedure and the risks and alternatives that a reasonable patient would find material; (ii) the fetus' probable gestational <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*967</span> age; and (iii) the medical risks involved in carrying her pregnancy to term. Section 3205(a)(2) requires a physician or a nonphysician counselor to inform the woman that (i) the state health department publishes free materials describing the fetus at different stages and listing abortion alternatives; (ii) medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care; and (iii) the child's father is liable for child support. The Act also imposes a 24-hour waiting period between the time that the woman receives the required information and the time that the physician is allowed to perform the abortion. See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., <i>ante,</i> at 902-904.</p>\\\\n<p>This Court has held that it is certainly within the province of the States to require a woman's voluntary and informed consent to an abortion. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 760. Here, Pennsylvania seeks to further its legitimate interest in obtaining informed consent by ensuring that each woman \\\\\\\"is aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, but also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 798-799 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>We conclude that this provision of the statute is rationally related to the State's interest in assuring that a woman's consent to an abortion be a fully informed decision.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 3205(a)(1) requires a physician to disclose certain information about the abortion procedure and its risks and alternatives. This requirement is certainly no large burden, as the Court of Appeals found that \\\\\\\"the record shows that the clinics, without exception, insist on providing this information to women before an abortion is performed.\\\\\\\" 947 F. 2d, at 703. We are of the view that this information \\\\\\\"clearly is related to maternal health and to the State's legitimate purpose in requiring informed consent.\\\\\\\" <i>Akron</i> v. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*968</span> <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S., at 446. An accurate description of the gestational age of the fetus and of the risks involved in carrying a child to term helps to further both those interests and the State's legitimate interest in unborn human life. See <i>id.,</i> at 445-446, n. 37 (required disclosure of gestational age of the fetus \\\\\\\"certainly is not objectionable\\\\\\\"). Although petitioners contend that it is unreasonable for the State to require that a physician, as opposed to a nonphysician counselor, disclose this information, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a State \\\\\\\"may rationally decide that physicians are better qualified than counselors to impart this information and answer questions about the medical aspects of the available alternatives.\\\\\\\" 947 F. 2d, at 704.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 3205(a)(2) compels the disclosure, by a physician or a counselor, of information concerning the availability of paternal child support and state-funded alternatives if the woman decides to proceed with her pregnancy. Here again, the Court of Appeals observed that \\\\\\\"the record indicates that most clinics already require that a counselor consult in person with the woman about alternatives to abortion before the abortion is performed.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 704-705. And petitioners do not claim that the information required to be disclosed by statute is in any way false or inaccurate; indeed, the Court of Appeals found it to be \\\\\\\"relevant, accurate, and noninflammatory.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 705. We conclude that this required presentation of \\\\\\\"balanced information\\\\\\\" is rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in ensuring that the woman's consent is truly informed, <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 830 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and in addition furthers the State's interest in preserving unborn life. That the information might create some uncertainty and persuade some women to forgo abortions does not lead to the conclusion that the Constitution forbids the provision of such information. Indeed, it only demonstrates that this information might <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*969</span> very well make a difference, and that it is therefore relevant to a woman's informed choice. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 801 (White, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"[T]he ostensible objective of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> is not maximizing the number of abortions, but maximizing choice\\\\\\\"). We acknowledge that in <i>Thornburgh</i> this Court struck down informed consent requirements similar to the ones at issue here. See <i>id.,</i> at 760-764. It is clear, however, that while the detailed framework of <i>Roe</i> led to the Court's invalidation of those informational requirements, they \\\\\\\"would have been sustained under any traditional standard of judicial review, . . . or for any other surgical procedure except abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S., at 517 (plurality opinion) (citing <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 802 (White, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting)). In light of our rejection of <i>Roe</i> `s \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" approach to this subject, we do not regard <i>Thornburgh</i> as controlling.</p>\\\\n<p>For the same reason, we do not feel bound to follow this Court's previous holding that a State's 24-hour mandatory waiting period is unconstitutional. See <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra,</i> at 449-451. Petitioners are correct that such a provision will result in delays for some women that might not otherwise exist, therefore placing a burden on their liberty. But the provision in no way prohibits abortions, and the informed consent and waiting period requirements do not apply in the case of a medical emergency. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a), (b) (1990). We are of the view that, in providing time for reflection and reconsideration, the waiting period helps ensure that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, and reasonably furthers the State's legitimate interest in maternal health and in the unborn life of the fetus. It \\\\\\\"is surely a small cost to impose to ensure that the woman's decision is well considered in light of its certain and irreparable consequences <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*970</span> on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own.\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 474 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>In addition to providing her own informed consent, before an unemancipated woman under the age of 18 may obtain an abortion she must either furnish the consent of one of her parents, or must opt for the judicial procedure that allows her to bypass the consent requirement. Under the judicial bypass option, a minor can obtain an abortion if a state court finds that she is capable of giving her informed consent and has indeed given such consent, <i>or</i> determines that an abortion is in her best interests. Records of these court proceedings are kept confidential. The Act directs the state trial court to render a decision within three days of the woman's application, and the entire procedure, including appeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court, is to last no longer than eight business days. The parental consent requirement does not apply in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3206 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., <i>ante,</i> at 904-906.</p>\\\\n<p>This provision is entirely consistent with this Court's previous decisions involving parental consent requirements. See <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (upholding parental consent requirement with a similar judicial bypass option); <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra,</i> at 439-440 (approving of parental consent statutes that include a judicial bypass option allowing a pregnant minor to \\\\\\\"demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests\\\\\\\"); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622 (1979).</p>\\\\n<p>We think it beyond dispute that a State \\\\\\\"has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*971</span> impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.\\\\\\\" <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S., at 444 (opinion of Stevens, J.). A requirement of parental consent to abortion, like myriad other restrictions placed upon minors in other contexts, is reasonably designed to further this important and legitimate state interest. In our view, it is entirely \\\\\\\"rational and fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, the family will strive to give a lonely or even terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature.\\\\\\\" <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S., at 520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 91 (Stewart, J., concurring) (\\\\\\\"There can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child\\\\\\\"). We thus conclude that Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement should be upheld.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 3209 of the Act contains the spousal notification provision. It requires that, before a physician may perform an abortion on a married woman, the woman must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her planned abortion. A woman is not required to notify her husband if (1) her husband is not the father, (2) her husband, after diligent effort, cannot be located, (3) the pregnancy is the result of a spousal sexual assault that has been reported to the authorities, or (4) the woman has reason to believe that notifying her husband is likely to result in the infliction of bodily injury upon her by him or by another individual. In addition, a woman is exempted from the notification requirement in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., <i>ante,</i> at 908-909.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*972</span> We first emphasize that Pennsylvania has not imposed a spousal <i>consent</i> requirement of the type the Court struck down in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 67-72. Missouri's spousal consent provision was invalidated in that case because of the Court's view that it unconstitutionally granted to the husband \\\\\\\"a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 71. But the provision here involves a much less intrusive requirement of spousal <i>notification,</i> not consent. Such a law requiring only notice to the husband \\\\\\\"does not give any third party the legal right to make the [woman's] decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortion should she choose to have one performed.\\\\\\\" <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota, supra,</i> at 496 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see <i>H. L.</i> v. <i>Matheson,</i> 450 U. S., at 411, n. 17. <i>Danforth</i> thus does not control our analysis. Petitioners contend that it should, however; they argue that the real effect of such a notice requirement is to give the power to husbands to veto a woman's abortion choice. The District Court indeed found that the notification provision created a risk that some woman who would otherwise have an abortion will be prevented from having one. 947 F. 2d, at 712. For example, petitioners argue, many notified husbands will prevent abortions through physical force, psychological coercion, and other types of threats. But Pennsylvania has incorporated exceptions in the notice provision in an attempt to deal with these problems. For instance, a woman need not notify her husband if the pregnancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or if she has reason to believe that she would suffer bodily injury as a result of the notification. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209(b) (1990). Furthermore, because this is a facial challenge to the Act, it is insufficient for petitioners to show that the notification provision \\\\\\\"might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances.\\\\\\\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Salerno,</i> 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Thus, it is not enough for petitioners <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*973</span> to show that, in some \\\\\\\"worst case\\\\\\\" circumstances, the notice provision will operate as a grant of veto power to husbands. <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S., at 514. Because they are making a facial challenge to the provision, they must \\\\\\\"show that no set of circumstances exists under which the [provision] would be valid.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). This they have failed to do.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*974</span> The question before us is therefore whether the spousal notification requirement rationally furthers any legitimate state interests. We conclude that it does. First, a husband's interests in procreation within marriage and in the potential life of his unborn child are certainly substantial ones. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 69 (\\\\\\\"We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 93 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S., at 541. The State itself has legitimate interests both in protecting these interests of the father and in protecting the potential life of the fetus, and the spousal notification requirement is reasonably related to advancing those state interests. By providing that a husband will usually know of his spouse's intent to have an abortion, the provision makes it more likely that the husband will participate in deciding the fate of his unborn child, a possibility that might otherwise have been denied him. This participation might in some cases result in a decision to proceed with the pregnancy. As Judge Alito observed in his dissent below, \\\\\\\"[t]he Pennsylvania legislature could have rationally believed that some married women are initially inclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands' knowledge because of perceived problems\\u00c2\\u2014such as economic constraints, future plans, or the husbands' previously expressed <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*975</span> opposition\\u00c2\\u2014that may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion.\\\\\\\" 947 F. 2d, at 726 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>The State also has a legitimate interest in promoting \\\\\\\"the integrity of the marital relationship.\\\\\\\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209(a) (1990). This Court has previously recognized \\\\\\\"the importance of the marital relationship in our society.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 69. In our view, the spousal notice requirement is a rational attempt by the State to improve truthful communication between spouses and encourage collaborative decision making, and thereby fosters marital integrity. See <i>Labine</i> v. <i>Vincent,</i> 401 U. S. 532, 538 (1971) (\\\\\\\"[T]he power to make rules to establish, protect, and strengthen family life\\\\\\\" is committed to the state legislatures). Petitioners argue that the notification requirement does not further any such interest; they assert that the majority of wives already notify their husbands of their abortion decisions, and the remainder have excellent reasons for keeping their decisions a secret. In the first case, they argue, the law is unnecessary, and in the second case it will only serve to foster marital discord and threats of harm. Thus, petitioners see the law as a totally irrational means of furthering whatever legitimate interest the State might have. But, in our view, it is unrealistic to assume that every husband-wife relationship is either (1) so perfect that this type of truthful and important communication will take place as a matter of course, or (2) so imperfect that, upon notice, the husband will react selfishly, violently, or contrary to the best interests of his wife. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 103-104 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (making a similar point in the context of a parental consent statute). The spousal notice provision will admittedly be unnecessary in some circumstances, and possibly harmful in others, but \\\\\\\"the existence of particular cases in which a feature of a statute performs no function (or is even counter productive) <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*976</span> ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitutional or even constitutionally suspect.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 800 (White, J., dissenting). The Pennsylvania Legislature was in a position to weigh the likely benefits of the provision against its likely adverse effects, and presumably concluded, on balance, that the provision would be beneficial. Whether this was a wise decision or not, we cannot say that it was irrational. We therefore conclude that the spousal notice provision comports with the Constitution. See <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S., at 325-326 (\\\\\\\"It is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests . . . is wise social policy\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>D</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act also imposes various reporting requirements. Section 3214(a) requires that abortion facilities file a report on each abortion performed. The reports do not include the identity of the women on whom abortions are performed, but they do contain a variety of information about the abortions. For example, each report must include the identities of the performing and referring physicians, the gestational age of the fetus at the time of abortion, and the basis for any medical judgment that a medical emergency existed. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3214(a)(1), (5), (10) (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., <i>ante,</i> at 909-911. The District Court found that these reports are kept completely confidential. 947 F. 2d, at 716. We further conclude that these reporting requirements rationally further the State's legitimate interests in advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical information with respect to patients, and in ensuring compliance with other provisions of the Act.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 3207 of the Act requires each abortion facility to file a report with its name and address, as well as the names <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*977</span> and addresses of any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated organizations. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3207(b) (1990). Section 3214(f) further requires each facility to file quarterly reports stating the total number of abortions performed, broken down by trimester. Both of these reports are available to the public only if the facility received state funds within the preceding 12 months. See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., <i>ante,</i> at 906, 911. Petitioners do not challenge the requirement that facilities provide this information. They contend, however, that the forced public disclosure of the information given by facilities receiving public funds serves no legitimate state interest. We disagree. Records relating to the expenditure of public funds are generally available to the public under Pennsylvania law. See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 66.1, 66.2 (Purdon 1959 and Supp. 1991-1992). As the Court of Appeals observed, \\\\\\\"[w]hen a state provides money to a private commercial enterprise, there is a legitimate public interest in informing taxpayers who the funds are benefiting and what services the funds are supporting.\\\\\\\" 947 F. 2d, at 718. These reporting requirements rationally further this legitimate state interest.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>E</h2>\\\\n<p>Finally, petitioners challenge the medical emergency exception provided for by the Act. The existence of a medical emergency exempts compliance with the Act's informed consent, parental consent, and spousal notice requirements. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c) (1990). The Act defines a \\\\\\\"medical emergency\\\\\\\" as</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*978</span> and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 3203.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Petitioners argued before the District Court that the statutory definition was inadequate because it did not cover three serious conditions that pregnant women can suffer\\u00c2\\u2014 preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and prematurely ruptured membrane. The District Court agreed with petitioners that the medical emergency exception was inadequate, but the Court of Appeals reversed this holding. In construing the medical emergency provision, the Court of Appeals first observed that all three conditions do indeed present the risk of serious injury or death when an abortion is not performed, and noted that the medical profession's uniformly prescribed treatment for each of the three conditions is an immediate abortion. See 947 F. 2d, at 700-701. Finding that \\\\\\\"[t]he Pennsylvania legislature did not choose the wording of its medical emergency exception in a vacuum,\\\\\\\" the court read the exception as intended \\\\\\\"to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 701. It thus concluded that the exception encompassed each of the three dangerous conditions pointed to by petitioners.</p>\\\\n<p>We observe that Pennsylvania's present definition of medical emergency is almost an exact copy of that State's definition at the time of this Court's ruling in <i>Thornburgh,</i> one which the Court made reference to with apparent approval. 476 U. S., at 771 (\\\\\\\"It is clear that the Pennsylvania Legislature knows how to provide a medical-emergency exception when it chooses to do so\\\\\\\").<sup>[3]</sup> We find that the interpretation <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*979</span> of the Court of Appeals in these cases is eminently reasonable, and that the provision thus should be upheld. When a woman is faced with any condition that poses a \\\\\\\"significant threat to [her] life or health,\\\\\\\" she is exempted from the Act's consent and notice requirements and may proceed immediately with her abortion.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>For the reasons stated, we therefore would hold that each of the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute is consistent with the Constitution. It bears emphasis that our conclusion in this regard does not carry with it any necessary approval of these regulations. Our task is, as always, to decide only whether the challenged provisions of a law comport with the United States Constitution. If,as we believe,these do,their wisdom as a matter of public policy is for the people of Pennsylvania to decide.</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 532 (1989) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S. 502, 520 (1990) <i>(Akron II)</i> (concurring opinion). The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not <i>require</i> them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges, \\\\\\\"where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 851. The Court is correct in adding the qualification that this \\\\\\\"assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> \\u00c2\\u2014but the crucial part of that qualification <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*980</span> is the penultimate word. A State's choice between two positions on which reasonable people can disagree is constitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upon a \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" in the absolute sense. Laws against bigamy, for example\\u00c2\\u2014with which entire societies of reasonable people disagree\\u00c2\\u2014intrude upon men and women's liberty to marry and live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be a liberty specially \\\\\\\"protected\\\\\\\" by the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p>That is, quite simply, the issue in these cases: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both. The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not. I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views concerning the \\\\\\\"concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protected\\u00c2\\u2014because of two simple facts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.<sup>[1]</sup><i>Akron II, supra,</i> at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*981</span> The Court destroys the proposition, evidently meant to represent my position, that \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" includes \\\\\\\"only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 847 (citing <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D.,</i> 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J.)). That is not, however, what <i>Michael H.</i> says; it merely observes that, in defining \\\\\\\"liberty,\\\\\\\" we may not disregard a specific, \\\\\\\"relevant tradition protecting, or denying protection to, the asserted right,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> But the Court does not wish to be fettered by any such limitations on its preferences. The Court's statement that it is \\\\\\\"tempting\\\\\\\" to acknowledge the authoritativeness of tradition in order to \\\\\\\"cur[b] the discretion of federal judges,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 847, is of course rhetoric rather than reality; no government official is \\\\\\\"tempted\\\\\\\" to place restraints upon his own freedom of action, which is why Lord Act on did not say \\\\\\\"Power tends to purify.\\\\\\\" The Court's temptation is in the quite opposite and more natural direction\\u00c2\\u2014towards systematically eliminating checks upon its own power; and it succumbs.</p>\\\\n<p>Beyond that brief summary of the essence of my position, I will not swell the United States Reports with repetition of what I have said before; and applying the rational basis test, I would uphold the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety. I must, however, respond to a few of the more outrageous arguments in today's opinion, which it is beyond human nature to leave unanswered. I shall discuss each of them under a quotation from the Court's opinion to which they pertain.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The inescapable fact is that adjudication of sub- stantive due process claims may call upon the Court</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*982</span> in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 849.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Assuming that the question before us is to be resolved at such a level of philosophical abstraction, in such isolation from the traditions of American society, as by simply applying \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment,\\\\\\\" I do not see how that could possibly have produced the answer the Court arrived at in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Today's opinion describes the methodology of <i>Roe,</i> quite accurately, as weighing against the woman's interest the State's \\\\\\\"`important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 871 (quoting <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 162). But \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment\\\\\\\" does not begin by begging the question, as <i>Roe</i> and subsequent cases unquestionably did by assuming that what the State is protecting is the mere \\\\\\\"potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Roe, supra,</i> at 162; <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976); <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 386 (1979); <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 428 (1983) <i>(Akron I)</i><i>; </i><i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476, 482 (1983). The whole argument of abortion opponents is that what the Court calls the fetus and what others call the unborn child <i>is a human life.</i> Thus, whatever answer <i>Roe</i> came up with after conducting its \\\\\\\"balancing\\\\\\\" is bound to be wrong, unless it is correct that the human fetus is in some critical sense merely potentially human. There is of course no way to determine that as a legal matter; it is in fact a value judgment. Some societies have considered newborn children not yet human, or the incompetent elderly no longer so.</p>\\\\n<p>The authors of the joint opinion, of course, do not squarely contend that <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> was a <i>correct</i> application of \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment\\\\\\\"; merely that it must be followed, because of <i>stare decisis. Ante,</i> at 853, 861, 871. But in their exhaustive discussion of all the factors that go into the determination <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*983</span> of when <i>stare decisis</i> should be observed and when disregarded, they never mention \\\\\\\"how wrong was the decision on its face?\\\\\\\" Surely, if \\\\\\\"[t]he Court's power lies . .. in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 865, the \\\\\\\"substance\\\\\\\" part of the equation demands that plain error be acknowledged and eliminated. <i>Roe</i> was plainly wrong\\u00c2\\u2014even on the Court's methodology of \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment,\\\\\\\" and even more so (of course) if the proper criteria of text and tradition are applied.</p>\\\\n<p>The emptiness of the \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment\\\\\\\" that produced <i>Roe</i> is displayed in plain view by the fact that, after more than 19 years of effort by some of the brightest (and most determined) legal minds in the country, after more than 10 cases upholding abortion rights in this Court, and after dozens upon dozens of <i>amicus</i> briefs submitted in these and other cases, the best the Court can do to explain how it is that the word \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" <i>must</i> be thought to include the right to destroy human fetuses is to rattle off a collection of adjectives that simply decorate a value judgment and conceal a political choice. The right to abort, we are told, inheres in \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" because it is among \\\\\\\"a person's most basic decisions,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 849; it involves a \\\\\\\"most intimate and personal choic[e],\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 851; it is \\\\\\\"central to personal dignity and autonomy,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.;</i> it \\\\\\\"originate[s] within the zone of conscience and belief,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 852; it is \\\\\\\"too intimate and personal\\\\\\\" for state interference, <i>ibid.;</i> it reflects \\\\\\\"intimate views\\\\\\\" of a \\\\\\\"deep, personal character,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 853; it involves \\\\\\\"intimate relationships\\\\\\\" and notions of \\\\\\\"personal autonomy and bodily integrity,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 857; and it concerns a particularly \\\\\\\"`important decisio[n],' \\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 859 (citation omitted).<sup>[2]</sup> But it is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*984</span> obvious to anyone applying \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment\\\\\\\" that the same adjectives can be applied to many forms of conduct that this Court (including one of the Justices in today's majority, see <i>Bowers</i> v. <i>Hardwick,</i> 478 U. S. 186 (1986)) has held are <i>not</i> entitled to constitutional protection\\u00c2\\u2014because, like abortion, they are forms of conduct that have long been criminalized in American society. Those adjectives might be applied, for example, to homosexual sodomy, polygamy, adult incest, and suicide, all of which are equally \\\\\\\"intimate\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"deep[ly] personal\\\\\\\" decisions involving \\\\\\\"personal autonomy and bodily integrity,\\\\\\\" and all of which can constitutionally be proscribed because it is our unquestionable constitutional tradition that they are proscribable. It is not reasoned judgment that supports the Court's decision; only personal predilection. Justice Curtis's warning is as timely today as it was 135 years ago:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[W]hen a strict interpretation of the Constitution, according to the fixed rules which govern the interpretation of laws, is abandoned, and the theoretical opinions of individuals are allowed to control its meaning, we have no longer a Constitution; we are under the government of individual men, who for the time being have power to declare what the Constitution is, according to their own views of what it ought to mean.\\\\\\\" <i>Dred Scott</i> v. <i>Sandford,</i> 19 How. 393, 621 (1857) (dissenting opinion). \\\\\\\"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 844.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>One might have feared to encounter this august and sonorous phrase in an opinion defending the real <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> rather than the revised version fabricated today by the authors <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*985</span> of the joint opinion. The shortcomings of <i>Roe</i> did not include lack of clarity: Virtually all regulation of abortion before the third trimester was invalid. But to come across this phrase in the joint opinion\\u00c2\\u2014which calls upon federal district judges to apply an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard as doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin\\u00c2\\u2014is really more than one should have to bear.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion frankly concedes that the amorphous concept of \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" has been inconsistently applied by the Members of this Court in the few brief years since that \\\\\\\"test\\\\\\\" was first explicitly propounded by Justice O'Connor in her dissent in <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983). See <i>ante,</i> at 876.<sup>[3]</sup> Because the three Justices now wish to \\\\\\\"set forth a standard of general application,\\\\\\\" the joint opinion announces that \\\\\\\"it is important to clarify what is meant by an undue burden.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> I certainly agree with that, but I do not agree that the joint opinion succeeds in the announced endeavor. To the contrary, its efforts at clarification <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*986</span> make clear only that the standard is inherently manipulable and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice.</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion explains that a state regulation imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" if it \\\\\\\"has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 877; see also <i>ante,</i> at 877-879. An obstacle is \\\\\\\"substantial,\\\\\\\" we are told, if it is \\\\\\\"calculated[,] [not] to inform the woman's free choice, [but to] hinder it.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 877.<sup>[4]</sup> This latter statement cannot <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*987</span> possibly mean what it says. <i>Any</i> regulation of abortion that is intended to advance what the joint opinion concedes is the State's \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" interest in protecting unborn life will be \\\\\\\"calculated [to] hinder\\\\\\\" a decision to have an abortion. It thus seems more accurate to say that the joint opinion would uphold abortion regulations only if they do not <i>unduly</i> hinder the woman's decision. That, of course, brings us right back to square one: Defining an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" as an \\\\\\\"undue hindrance\\\\\\\" (or a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\") hardly \\\\\\\"clarifies\\\\\\\" the test. Consciously or not, the joint opinion's verbal shell game will conceal raw judicial policy choices concerning what is \\\\\\\"appropriate\\\\\\\" abortion legislation.</p>\\\\n<p>The ultimately standard less nature of the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" inquiry is a reflection of the underlying fact that the concept has no principled or coherent legal basis. As The Chief Justice points out, <i>Roe</i> `s strict-scrutiny standard \\\\\\\"at least had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time <i>Roe</i> was decided,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 964, while \\\\\\\"[t]he same cannot be said for the `undue burden' standard, which is created largely out of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> The joint opinion is flatly wrong in asserting that \\\\\\\"our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized\\\\\\\" the permissibility of laws that do not impose an \\\\\\\"undue burden.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 873. It argues that the abortion right is similar to other rights in that a law \\\\\\\"not designed to strike at the right itself, [but which] has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to [exercise the right,]\\\\\\\" is not invalid. <i>Ante,</i> at 874. I agree, indeed I have <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*988</span> forcefully urged, that a law of general applicability which places only an incidental burden on a fundamental right does not infringe that right, see <i>R. A. V.</i> v. <i>St. Paul,</i> 505 U. S. 377, 389-390 (1992); <i>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 494 U. S. 872, 878-882 (1990), but that principle does not establish the quite different (and quite dangerous) proposition that a law which <i>directly</i> regulates a fundamental right will not be found to violate the Constitution unless it imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden.\\\\\\\" It is that, of course, which is at issue here: Pennsylvania has <i>consciously and directly</i> regulated conduct that our cases have held is constitutionally protected. The appropriate analogy, therefore, is that of a state law requiring purchasers of religious books to endure a 24-hour waiting period, or to pay a nominal additional tax of 1\\u00c2\\u00a2. The joint opinion cannot possibly be correct in suggesting that we would uphold such legislation on the ground that it does not impose a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" to the exercise of First Amendment rights. The \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard is not at all the generally applicable principle the joint opinion pretends it to be; rather, it is a unique concept created specially for these cases, to preserve some judicial foothold in this ill-gotten territory. In claiming otherwise, the three Justices show their willingness to place all constitutional rights at risk in an effort to preserve what they deem the \\\\\\\"central holding in <i>Roe.</i> \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 873.</p>\\\\n<p>The rootless nature of the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard, a phrase plucked out of context from our earlier abortion decisions, see n. 3, <i>supra,</i> is further reflected in the fact that the joint opinion finds it necessary expressly to repudiate the more narrow formulations used in Justice O'Connor's earlier opinions. <i>Ante,</i> at 876-877. Those opinions stated that a statute imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" if it imposes \\\\\\\"<i>absolute</i> obstacles or <i>severe</i> limitations on the abortion decision,\\\\\\\" <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 464 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added); see also <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (dissenting <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*989</span> opinion). Those strong adjectives are conspicuously missing from the joint opinion, whose authors have for some unexplained reason now determined that a burden is \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\" if it merely imposes a \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" obstacle to abortion decisions. See, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 895, 901. Justice O'Connor has also abandoned (again without explanation) the view she expressed in <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (dissenting opinion), that a medical regulation which imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" could nevertheless be upheld if it \\\\\\\"reasonably relate[s] to the preservation and protection of maternal health,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 505 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In today's version, even health measures will be upheld only \\\\\\\"<i>if they do not constitute an undue burden,</i>\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 878 (emphasis added). Gone too is Justice O'Connor's statement that \\\\\\\"the State possesses <i>compelling</i> interests in the protection of potential human life . . . throughout pregnancy,\\\\\\\" <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 461 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added); see also <i>Ashcroft, supra,</i> at 505 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); instead, the State's interest in unborn human life is stealthily downgraded to a merely \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"profound\\\\\\\" interest, <i>ante,</i> at 876, 878. (That had to be done, of course, since designating the interest as \\\\\\\"compelling\\\\\\\" throughout pregnancy would have been, shall we say, a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" to the joint opinion's determined effort to reaffirm what it views as the \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\" of <i>Roe.</i> See <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 420, n. 1.) And \\\\\\\"viability\\\\\\\" is no longer the \\\\\\\"arbitrary\\\\\\\" dividing line previously decried by Justice O'Connor in <i>Akron I, id.,</i> at 461; the Court now announces that \\\\\\\"the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 860.<sup>[5]</sup> It is difficult to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*990</span> maintain the illusion that we are interpreting a Constitution rather than inventing one, when we amend its provisions so breezily.</p>\\\\n<p>Because the portion of the joint opinion adopting and describing the undue burden test provides no more useful guidance than the empty phrases discussed above, one must turn to the 23 pages applying that standard to the present facts for further guidance. In evaluating Pennsylvania's abortion law, the joint opinion relies extensively on the factual findings of the District Court, and repeatedly qualifies its conclusions by noting that they are contingent upon the record developed in these cases. Thus, the joint opinion would uphold the 24-hour waiting period contained in the Pennsylvania statute's informed consent provision, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 3205 (1990), because \\\\\\\"the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable health risk,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 885. The three Justices therefore conclude that \\\\\\\"on the record before us, . . . we are not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an undue burden.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 887. The requirement that a doctor provide the information pertinent to informed consent would also be upheld because \\\\\\\"there is no evidence on this record that [this requirement] would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 884. Similarly, the joint opinion would uphold the reporting requirements of the Act, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3207, 3214, because \\\\\\\"there is no . . . showing on the record before us\\\\\\\" that these requirements constitute a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*991</span> to abortion decisions. <i>Ante,</i> at 901. But at the same time the opinion pointedly observes that these reporting requirements may increase the costs of abortions and that \\\\\\\"at some point [that fact] could become a substantial obstacle.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Most significantly, the joint opinion's conclusion that the spousal notice requirement of the Act, see \\u00c2\\u00a7 3209, imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" is based in large measure on the District Court's \\\\\\\"detailed findings of fact,\\\\\\\" which the joint opinion sets out at great length, <i>ante,</i> at 888-891.</p>\\\\n<p>I do not, of course, have any objection to the notion that, in applying legal principles, one should rely only upon the facts that are contained in the record or that are properly subject to judicial notice.<sup>[6]</sup> But what is remarkable about the joint opinion's fact-intensive analysis is that it does not result in any measurable clarification of the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard. Rather, the approach of the joint opinion is, for the most part, simply to highlight certain facts in the record that apparently strike the three Justices as particularly significant in establishing (or refuting) the existence of an undue burden; after describing these facts, the opinion then simply announces that the provision either does or does not impose a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" or an \\\\\\\"undue burden.\\\\\\\" See, <i>e. g., ante,</i> at 880, 884-885, 887, 893-894, 895, 901. We do not know whether the same conclusions could have been reached on a different record, or in what respects the record would have had to differ before an opposite conclusion would have been <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*992</span> appropriate. The inherently standard less nature of this inquiry invites the district judge to give effect to his personal preferences about abortion. By finding and relying upon the right facts, he can invalidate, it would seem, almost any abortion restriction that strikes him as \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014subject, of course, to the possibility of being reversed by a court of appeals or Supreme Court that is as unconstrained in reviewing his decision as he was in making it.</p>\\\\n<p>To the extent I can discern <i>any</i> meaningful content in the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard as applied in the joint opinion, it appears to be that a State may not regulate abortion in such a way as to reduce significantly its incidence. The joint opinion repeatedly emphasizes that an important factor in the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" analysis is whether the regulation \\\\\\\"prevent[s] a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 893; whether a \\\\\\\"significant number of women . . . are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 894; and whether the regulation often \\\\\\\"deters\\\\\\\" women from seeking abortions, <i>ante,</i> at 897. We are not told, however, what forms of \\\\\\\"deterrence\\\\\\\" are impermissible or what degree of success in deterrence is too much to be tolerated. If, for example, a State required a woman to read a pamphlet describing, with illustrations, the facts of fetal development before she could obtain an abortion, the effect of such legislation might be to \\\\\\\"deter\\\\\\\" a \\\\\\\"significant number of women\\\\\\\" from procuring abortions, thereby seemingly allowing a district judge to invalidate it as an undue burden. Thus, despite flowery rhetoric about the State's \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"profound\\\\\\\" interest in \\\\\\\"potential human life,\\\\\\\" and criticism of <i>Roe</i> for undervaluing that interest, the joint opinion permits the State to pursue that interest only so long as it is not too successful. As Justice Blackmun recognizes (with evident hope), <i>ante,</i> at 926, the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard may ultimately require the invalidation of each provision upheld today if it can be shown, on a better record, that the State is too effectively \\\\\\\"express[ing] a preference <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*993</span> for childbirth over abortion,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 883. Reason finds no refuge in this jurisprudence of confusion.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"While we appreciate the weight of the arguments . . that <i>Roe</i> should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of <i>Roe</i> are outweighed by the explication of individ- ual liberty we have given combined with the force of <i>stare decisis.</i>\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 853.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The Court's reliance upon <i>stare decisis</i> can best be described as contrived. It insists upon the necessity of adhering not to all of <i>Roe,</i> but only to what it calls the \\\\\\\"central holding.\\\\\\\" It seems to me that <i>stare decisis</i> ought to be applied even to the doctrine of <i>stare decisis,</i> and I confess never to have heard of this new, keep-what-you-want-and-throwaway-the-rest version. I wonder whether, as applied to <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), for example, the new version of <i>stare decisis</i> would be satisfied if we allowed courts to review the constitutionality of only those statutes that (like the one in <i>Marbury</i>) pertain to the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>\\\\n<p>I am certainly not in a good position to dispute that the Court <i>has saved</i> the \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\" of <i>Roe,</i> since to do that effectively I would have to know what the Court has saved, which in turn would require me to understand (as I do not) what the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" test means. I must confess, however, that I have always thought, and I think a lot of other people have always thought, that the arbitrary trimester framework, which the Court today discards, was quite as central to <i>Roe</i> as the arbitrary viability test, which the Court today retains. It seems particularly ungrateful to carve the trimester framework out of the core of <i>Roe,</i> since its very rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability of the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" test) is probably the only reason the Court is able to say, in urging <i>stare decisis,</i> that <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"has in no sense proven `unworkable,' \\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 855. I suppose the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*994</span> Court is entitled to call a \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\" whatever it wants to call a \\\\\\\"central holding\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014which is, come to think of it, perhaps one of the difficulties with this modified version of <i>stare decisis.</i> I thought I might note, however, that the following portions of <i>Roe</i> have not been saved:</p>\\\\n<p>\\u00c2\\u2022 Under <i>Roe,</i> requiring that a woman seeking an abortion be provided truthful information about abortion before giving informed written consent is unconstitutional, if the information is designed to influence her choice. <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 759-765; <i>Akron I,</i> 462 U. S., at 442-445. Under the joint opinion's \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" regime (as applied today, at least) such a requirement is constitutional. <i>Ante,</i> at 881-885.</p>\\\\n<p>\\u00c2\\u2022 Under <i>Roe,</i> requiring that information be provided by a doctor, rather than by nonphysician counselors, is unconstitutional. <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 446-449. Under the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" regime (as applied today, at least) it is not. <i>Ante,</i> at 884-885.</p>\\\\n<p>\\u00c2\\u2022 Under <i>Roe,</i> requiring a 24-hour waiting period between the time the woman gives her informed consent and the time of the abortion is unconstitutional. <i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 449-451. Under the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" regime (as applied today, at least) it is not. <i>Ante,</i> at 885-887.</p>\\\\n<p>\\u00c2\\u2022 Under <i>Roe,</i> requiring detailed reports that include demographic data about each woman who seeks an abortion and various information about each abortion is unconstitutional. <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at 765-768. Under the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" regime (as applied today, at least) it generally is not. <i>Ante,</i> at 900-901.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in <i>Roe</i> . . . , its decision has a dimension that the resolu- tion of the normal case does not carry. It is the di- mension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*995</span> national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Con- stitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 866-867.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The Court's description of the place of <i>Roe</i> in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did <i>Roe</i> not, as the Court suggests, <i>resolve</i> the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish it, by elevating it to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve. National politics were not plagued by abortion protests, national abortion lobbying, or abortion marches on Congress before <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> was decided. Profound disagreement existed among our citizens over the issue\\u00c2\\u2014as it does over other issues, such as the death penalty\\u00c2\\u2014but that disagreement was being worked out at the state level. As with many other issues, the division of sentiment within each State was not as closely balanced as it was among the population of the Nation as a whole, meaning not only that more people would be satisfied with the results of state-by-state resolution, but also that those results would be more stable. Pre-<i>Roe,</i> moreover, political compromise was possible.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> `s mandate for abortion on demand destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. At the same time, <i>Roe</i> created a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion proponents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attached to the act. (\\\\\\\"If the Constitution <i>guarantees</i> abortion, how can it be bad?\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014not an accurate line of thought, but a natural one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is not for me to say that they are wrong. But to portray <i>Roe</i> as the states manlike \\\\\\\"settlement\\\\\\\" of a divisive issue, a jurisprudential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is nothing less than Orwellian. <i>Roe</i> fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*996</span> in particular, ever since. And by keeping us in the abortionumpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that disruption, rather than of any <i>Pax Roeana,</i> that the Court's new majority decrees.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[T]o overrule under fire . . . would subvert the Court's legitimacy . . . . \\\\\\\". . .

Lincoln, First Inaugural Address (Mar. 4, 1861), reprinted in Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc.

S., at 154-156.<sup>[7]</sup> To make matters worse, two of the three, in order thus to remain steadfast, had to abandon previously stated positions. See n. 4, <i>supra;</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 988-990. It is beyond me how the Court expects these accommodations to be accepted \\\\\\\"as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 865-866. The only principle the Court \\\\\\\"adheres\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*998</span> to, it seems to me, is the principle that the Court must be seen as standing by <i>Roe.</i> That is not a principle of law (which is what I thought the Court was talking about), but a principle of <i>Realpolitik</i>\\u00c2\\u2014and a wrong one at that.</p>\\\\n<p>I cannot agree with, indeed I am appalled by, the Court's suggestion that the decision whether to stand by an erroneous constitutional decision must be strongly influenced\\u00c2\\u2014 <i>against</i> overruling, no less\\u00c2\\u2014by the substantial and continuing public opposition the decision has generated. The Court's judgment that any other course would \\\\\\\"subvert the Court's legitimacy\\\\\\\" must be another consequence of reading the error-filled history book that described the deeply divided country brought together by <i>Roe.</i> In my history book, the Court was covered with dishonor and deprived of legitimacy by <i>Dred Scott</i> v. <i>Sandford,</i> 19 How. 393 (1857), an erroneous (and widely opposed) opinion that it did not abandon, rather than by <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Parrish,</i> 300 U. S. 379 (1937), which produced the famous \\\\\\\"switch in time\\\\\\\" from the Court's erroneous (and widely opposed) constitutional opposition to the social measures of the New Deal. (Both <i>Dred Scott</i> and one line of the cases resisting the New Deal rested upon the concept of \\\\\\\"substantive due process\\\\\\\" that the Court praises and employs today. Indeed, <i>Dred Scott</i> was \\\\\\\"very possibly the first application of substantive due process in the Supreme Court, the original precedent for <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York</i> and <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> \\\\\\\" D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court 271 (1985) (footnotes omitted).)</p>\\\\n<p>But whether it would \\\\\\\"subvert the Court's legitimacy\\\\\\\" or not, the notion that we would decide a case differently from the way we otherwise would have in order to show that we can stand firm against public disapproval is frightening. It is a bad enough idea, even in the head of someone like me, who believes that the text of the Constitution, and our traditions, say what they say and there is no fiddling with them. But when it is in the mind of a Court that believes the Constitution <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*999</span> has an evolving meaning, see <i>ante,</i> at 848; that the Ninth Amendment's reference to \\\\\\\"othe[r]\\\\\\\" rights is not a disclaimer, but a charter for action, <i>ibid.;</i> and that the function of this Court is to \\\\\\\"speak before all others for [the people's] constitutional ideals\\\\\\\" unrestrained by meaningful text or tradition\\u00c2\\u2014then the notion that the Court must adhere to a decision for as long as the decision faces \\\\\\\"great opposition\\\\\\\" and the Court is \\\\\\\"under fire\\\\\\\" acquires a character of almost czarist arrogance. We are offended by these marchers who descend upon us, every year on the anniversary of <i>Roe,</i> to protest our saying that the Constitution requires what our society has never thought the Constitution requires. These people who refuse to be \\\\\\\"tested by following\\\\\\\" must be taught a lesson. We have no Cossacks, but at least we can stubbornly refuse to abandon an erroneous opinion that we might otherwise change\\u00c2\\u2014to show how little they intimidate us.</p>\\\\n<p>Of course, as The Chief Justice points out, we have been subjected to what the Court calls \\\\\\\"`political pressure' \\\\\\\" by <i>both</i> sides of this issue. <i>Ante,</i> at 963. Maybe today's decision <i>not</i> to overrule <i>Roe</i> will be seen as buckling to pressure from <i>that</i> direction. Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perception\\u00c2\\u2014a job not for lawyers but for political campaign managers\\u00c2\\u2014the Justices should do what is <i>legally</i> right by asking two questions: (1) Was <i>Roe</i> correctly decided? (2) Has <i>Roe</i> succeeded in producing a settled body of law? If the answer to both questions is no, <i>Roe</i> should undoubtedly be overruled.</p>\\\\n<p>In truth, I am as distressed as the Court is\\u00c2\\u2014and expressed my distress several years ago, see <i>Webster,</i> 492 U. S., at 535\\u00c2\\u2014about the \\\\\\\"political pressure\\\\\\\" directed to the Court: the marches, the mail, the protests aimed at inducing us to change our opinions. How upsetting it is,that so many of our citizens (good people, not lawless ones, on both sides of this abortion issue, and on various sides of other issues as well) think that we Justices should properly take into account <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1000</span> their views, as though we were engaged not in ascertaining an objective law but in determining some kind of social consensus. The Court would profit, I think, from giving less attention to the <i>fact</i> of this distressing phenomenon, and more attention to the <i>cause</i> of it. That cause permeates today's opinion: a new mode of constitutional adjudication that relies not upon text and traditional practice to determine the law, but upon what the Court calls \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 849, which turns out to be nothing but philosophical predilection and moral intuition. All manner of \\\\\\\"liberties,\\\\\\\" the Court tells us, inhere in the Constitution and are enforceable by this Court\\u00c2\\u2014not just those mentioned in the text or established in the traditions of our society. <i>Ante,</i> at 847-849. Why even the Ninth Amendment\\u00c2\\u2014which says only that \\\\\\\"[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014is, despite our contrary understanding for almost 200 years, a literally boundless source of additional, unnamed, unhinted-at \\\\\\\"rights,\\\\\\\" definable and enforceable by us, through \\\\\\\"reasoned judgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 848-849.</p>\\\\n<p>What makes all this relevant to the bothersome application of \\\\\\\"political pressure\\\\\\\" against the Court are the twin facts that the American people love democracy and the American people are not fools. As long as this Court thought (and the people thought) that we Justices were doing essentially lawyers' work up here\\u00c2\\u2014reading text and discerning our society's traditional understanding of that text\\u00c2\\u2014the public pretty much left us alone. Texts and traditions are facts to study, not convictions to demonstrate about. But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making <i>value judgments;</i> if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Weisman,</i> 505 U. S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1001</span> judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (<i>ought</i> to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school\\u00c2\\u2014maybe better. If, indeed, the \\\\\\\"liberties\\\\\\\" protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people <i>should</i> demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement <i>their</i> values instead of <i>ours.</i> Not only that, but confirmation hearings for new Justices <i>should</i> deteriorate into questionand-answer sessions in which Senators go through a list of their constituents' most favored and most disfavored alleged constitutional rights, and seek the nominee's commitment to support or oppose them. Value judgments, after all, should be voted on, not dictated; and if our Constitution has somehow accidently committed them to the Supreme Court, at least we can have a sort of plebiscite each time a new nominee to that body is put forward. Justice Blackmun not only regards this prospect with equanimity, he solicits it. <i>Ante,</i> at 943.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>There is a poignant aspect to today's opinion. Its length, and what might be called its epic tone, suggest that its authors believe they are bringing to an end a troublesome era in the history of our Nation and of our Court. \\\\\\\"It is the dimension\\\\\\\" of authority, they say, to \\\\\\\"cal[l] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 867.</p>\\\\n<p>There comes vividly to mind a portrait by Emanuel Leutze that hangs in the Harvard Law School: Roger Brooke Taney, painted in 1859, the 82d year of his life, the 24th of his Chief Justiceship, the second after his opinion in <i>Dred Scott.</i> He is all in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanging limply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair. He sits facing the viewer and staring straight out. There <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1002</span> seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment. Perhaps he always looked that way, even when dwelling upon the happiest of thoughts. But those of us who know how the lustre of his great Chief Justiceship came to be eclipsed by <i>Dred Scott</i> cannot help believing that he had that case\\u00c2\\u2014its already apparent consequences for the Court and its soon-to-beplayed-out consequences for the Nation\\u00c2\\u2014burning on his mind. I expect that two years earlier he, too, had thought himself \\\\\\\"call[ing] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>It is no more realistic for us in this litigation, than it was for him in that, to think that an issue of the sort they both involved\\u00c2\\u2014an issue involving life and death, freedom and subjugation\\u00c2\\u2014can be \\\\\\\"speedily and finally settled\\\\\\\" by the Supreme Court, as President James Buchanan in his inaugural address said the issue of slavery in the territories would be. See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, p. 126 (1989). Quite to the contrary, by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.</p>\\\\n<p>We should get out of this area, where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]   Together with No. 91-902, <i>Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al.</i> v. <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania et al.,</i> also on certiorari to the same court.</p>\\\\n<p>[\\u00c2\\u2020]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> were filed for the State of New York et al. by <i>Robert Abrams,</i> Attorney General of New York, <i>Jerry Boone,</i> Solicitor General, <i>Mary Ellen Burns,</i> Chief Assistant Attorney General, and <i>Sanford M.

Law.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>[1]  It is sometimes useful to view the issue of <i>stare decisis</i> from a historical perspective. In the last 19 years, 15 Justices have confronted the basic issue presented in <i>Roe</i> v.<i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Of those, 11 have voted as the majority does today: Chief Justice Burger, Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, and Powell, and Justices Blackmun, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and myself. Only four\\u00c2\\u2014all of whom happen to be on the Court today\\u00c2\\u2014have reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  Professor Dworkin has made this comment on the issue:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The suggestion that states are free to declare a fetus a person. . . . assumes that a state can curtail some persons' constitutional rights by adding new persons to the constitutional population. The constitutional rights of one citizen are of course very much affected by who or what else also has constitutional rights, because the rights of others may compete or conflict with his. So any power to increase the constitutional population by unilateral decision would be, in effect, a power to decrease rights the national Constitution grants to others.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\". . . If a state could declare trees to be persons with a constitutional right to life, it could prohibit publishing newspapers or books in spite of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, which could not be understood as a license to kill. . . . Once we understand that the suggestion we are considering has that implication, we must reject it. If a fetus is not part of the constitutional population, under the national constitutional arrangement, then states have no power to overrule that national arrangement by themselves declaring that fetuses have rights competitive with the constitutional rights of pregnant women.\\\\\\\" Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How <i>Roe</i> Should be Overruled, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 381, 400\\u00c2\\u2014 401 (1992).</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The state interest in protecting potential life may be compared to the state interest in protecting those who seek to immigrate to this country. A contemporary example is provided by the Haitians who have risked the perils of the sea in a desperate attempt to become \\\\\\\"persons\\\\\\\" protected by our laws. Humanitarian and practical concerns would support a state policy allowing those persons unrestricted entry; countervailing interests in population control support a policy of limiting the entry of these potential citizens. While the state interest in population control might be sufficient to justify strict enforcement of the immigration laws, that interest would not be sufficient to overcome a woman's liberty interest. Thus, a state interest in population control could not justify a state-imposed limit on family size or, for that matter, state-mandated abortions.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  As we noted in that opinion, the State's \\\\\\\"legitimate interest in protecting minor women from their own immaturity\\\\\\\" distinguished that case from <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983), which involved \\\\\\\"a provision that required that mature women, capable of consenting to an abortion, wait 24 hours after giving consent before undergoing an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Hodgson,</i> 497 U. S., at 449, n. 35.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  The joint opinion's reliance on the indirect effects of the regulation of constitutionally protected activity, see <i>ante,</i> at 873-874, is misplaced; what matters is not only the effect of a regulation but also the reason for the regulation. As I explained in <i>Hodgson:</i>\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of travel and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, <i>Shapiro</i> v. <i>Thompson,</i>  394 U. S. 618, 631 (1969), or deny prisoners the right to marry, <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Safley,</i> 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987). But the regulation of constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or she shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other than disagreement with the choice the individual has made. Cf. <i>Turner</i>  v. <i>Safley, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967). In the abortion area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use its own facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977); cf. <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive</i>  <i>Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 508-511 (1989); <i>id.,</i> at 523-524 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A State's value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support for decisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply substituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has a right to make for herself. Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause would be a nullity. A state policy favoring childbirth over abortion is not in itself a sufficient justification for overriding the woman's decision or for placing `obstacles\\u00c2\\u2014absolute or otherwise\\u00c2\\u2014in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion.' \\\\\\\" 497 U. S., at 435.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  The meaning of any legal standard can only be understood by reviewing the actual cases in which it is applied. For that reason, I discount both Justice Scalia's comments on past descriptions of the standard, see <i>post,</i> at 988-990 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and the attempt to give it crystal clarity in the joint opinion. The several opinions supporting the judgment in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), are less illuminating than the central holding of the case, which appears to have passed the test of time. The future may also demonstrate that a standard that analyzes both the severity of a regulatory burden and the legitimacy of its justification will provide a fully adequate framework for the review of abortion legislation even if the contours of the standard are not authoritatively articulated in any single opinion.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 71 (111th ed. 1991).</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  Although I agree that a parental-consent requirement (with the appropriate bypass) is constitutional, I do not join Part V\\u00c2\\u2014D of the joint opinion because its approval of Pennsylvania's informed parental-consent requirement is based on the reasons given in Part V\\u00c2\\u2014B, with which I disagree.</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  As I shall explain, the joint opinion and I disagree on the appropriate standard of review for abortion regulations. I do agree, however, that the reasons advanced by the joint opinion suffice to invalidate the spousal notification requirement under a strict scrutiny standard.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  I also join the Court's decision to uphold the medical emergency provision. As the Court notes, its interpretation is consistent with the essential holding of<i>Roe</i> that \\\\\\\"forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 880. As is apparent in my analysis below, however, this exception does not render constitutional the provisions which I conclude do not survive strict scrutiny.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  As the joint opinion acknowledges, <i>ante,</i> at 857, this Court has recognized the vital liberty interest of persons in refusing unwanted medical treatment. <i>Cruzan</i> v. <i>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health,</i> 497 U. S. 261 (1990). Just as the Due Process Clause protects the deeply personal decision of the individual to <i>refuse</i> medical treatment, it also must protect the deeply personal decision to <i>obtain</i> medical treatment, including a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  A growing number of commentators are recognizing this point. See, <i>e. g.,</i> L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \\u00c2\\u00a7 15-10, pp. 1353-1359 (2d ed. 1988); Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261, 350-380 (1992); Sunstein, Neutrality in Constitutional Law (With Special Reference to Pornography, Abortion, and Surrogacy), 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 31-44 (1992); cf. Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737, 788-791 (1989) (similar analysis under the rubric of privacy); MacKinnon, Reflections on Sex Equality Under Law, 100 Yale L. J. 1281, 1308-1324 (1991).</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  To say that restrictions on a right are subject to strict scrutiny is not to say that the right is absolute. Regulations can be upheld if they have no significant impact on the woman's exercise of her right and are justified by important state health objectives. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 65-67, 79-81 (1976) (upholding requirements of a woman's written consent and record keeping). But the Court today reaffirms the essential principle of <i>Roe</i> that a woman has the right \\\\\\\"to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 846. Under <i>Roe,</i> any more than <i>de minimis</i> interference is undue.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  The joint opinion agrees with <i>Roe</i>`s conclusion that viability occurs at 23 or 24 weeks at the earliest. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 860, with <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 160 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  While I do not agree with the joint opinion's conclusion that these provisions should be upheld, the joint opinion has remained faithful to principles this Court previously has announced in examining counseling provisions. For example, the joint opinion concludes that the \\\\\\\"information the State requires to be made available to the woman\\\\\\\" must be \\\\\\\"truthful and not misleading.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 882. Because the State's information must be \\\\\\\"calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 877, the measures must be designed to ensure that a woman's choice is \\\\\\\"mature and informed,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 883, not intimidated, imposed, or impelled. To this end, when the State requires the provision of certain information, the State may not alter the <i>manner</i> of presentation in order to inflict \\\\\\\"psychological abuse,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 893, designed to shock or unnerve a woman seeking to exercise her liberty right. This, for example, would appear to preclude a State from requiring a woman to view graphic literature or films detailing the performance of an abortion operation. Just as a visual preview of an operation to remove an appendix plays no part in a physician's securing informed consent to an appendectomy, a preview of scenes appurtenant to any major medical intrusion into the human body does not constructively inform the decision of a woman of the State's interest in the preservation of the woman's health or demonstrate the State's \\\\\\\"profound respect for the life of the unborn.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 877.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  The Court's decision in <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S. 417 (1990), validating a 48-hour waiting period for minors seeking an abortion to permit parental involvement does not alter this conclusion. Here the 24-hour delay is imposed on an <i>adult</i> woman. See <i>id.,</i> at 449-450, n. 35; <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 497 U. S. 502 (1990). Moreover, the statute in <i>Hodgson</i> did not require any delay once the minor obtained the affirmative consent of either a parent or the court.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  Because this information is so widely known, I am confident that a developed record can be made to show that the 24-hour delay, \\\\\\\"in a large fraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, . . . will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 895.</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  The judicial-bypass provision does not cure this violation.<i>Hodgson</i> is distinguishable, since these cases involve more than parental involvement or approval\\u00c2\\u2014rather, the Pennsylvania law requires that the parent receive information designed to discourage abortion in a face-to-face meeting with the physician. The bypass procedure cannot ensure that the parent would obtain the information, since in many instances, the parent would not even attend the hearing. A State may not place any restriction on a young woman's right to an abortion,however irrational,simply because it has provided a judicial bypass.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  Obviously, I do not share The Chief Justice's views of homosexuality as sexual deviance. See <i>Bowers,</i> 478 U. S., at 202-203, n. 2.</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  Justice Scalia urges the Court to \\\\\\\"get out of this area,\\\\\\\" <i>post,</i> at 1002, and leave questions regarding abortion entirely to the States, <i>post,</i> at 999-1000. Putting aside the fact that what he advocates is nothing short of an abdication by the Court of its constitutional responsibilities, Justice Scalia is uncharacteristically naive if he thinks that overruling <i>Roe</i> and holding that restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion are subject only to rational-basis review will enable the Court henceforth to avoid reviewing abortion-related issues. State efforts to regulate and prohibit abortion in a post-<i>Roe</i> world undoubtedly would raise a host of distinct and important constitutional questions meriting review by this Court. For example, does the Eighth Amendment impose any limits on the degree or kind of punishment a State can inflict upon physicians who perform, or women who undergo, abortions? What effect would differences among States in their approaches to abortion have on a woman's right to engage in interstate travel? Does the First Amendment permit States that choose not to criminalize abortion to ban all advertising providing information about where and how to obtain abortions?</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  Two years after <i>Roe,</i> the West German constitutional court, by contrast, struck down a law liberalizing access to abortion on the grounds that life developing within the womb is constitutionally protected. <i>Judgment of February 25, 1975,</i> 39 BVerfGE 1 (translated in Jonas &amp; Gorby, West German Abortion Decision: A Contrast to <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> 9 John Marshall J. Prac. &amp; Proc. 605 (1976)). In 1988, the Canadian Supreme Court followed reasoning similar to that of <i>Roe</i> in striking down a law that restricted abortion. <i>Morgentaler</i> v. <i>Queen,</i> 1 S. C. R. 30, 44 D. L. R. 4th 385 (1988).</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter appears to ignore this point in concluding that the spousal notice provision imposes an undue burden on the abortion decision. <i>Ante,</i> at 887-898. In most instances the notification requirement operates without difficulty. As the District Court found, the vast majority of wives seeking abortions notify and consult with their husbands, and thus suffer no burden as a result of the provision. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1360 (ED Pa. 1990). In other instances where a woman does not want to notify her husband, the Act provides exceptions. For example, notification is not required if the husband is not the father, if the pregnancy is the result of a reported spousal sexual assault, or if the woman fears bodily injury as a result of notifying her husband. Thus, in these instances as well, the notification provision imposes no obstacle to the abortion decision.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>The joint opinion puts to one side these situations where the regulation imposes no obstacle at all,and instead focuses on the group of married women who would not otherwise notify their husbands and who do not qualify for one of the exceptions. Having narrowed the focus, the joint opinion concludes that in a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of those cases, the notification provision operates as a substantial obstacle, <i>ante,</i> at 895, and that the provision is therefore invalid. There are certainly instances where a woman would prefer not to notify her husband, and yet does not qualify for an exception. For example, there are the situations of battered women who fear psychological abuse or injury to their children as a result of notification; because in these situations the women do not fear bodily injury, they do not qualify for an exception. And there are situations where a woman has become pregnant as a result of an unreported spousal sexual assault; when such an assault is unreported, no exception is available. But, as the District Court found, there are also instances where the woman prefers not to notify her husband for a variety of other reasons. See 744 F. Supp., at 1360. For example, a woman might desire to obtain an abortion without her husband's knowledge because of perceived economic constraints or her husband's previously expressed opposition to abortion. The joint opinion concentrates on the situations involving battered women and unreported spousal assault, and assumes, without any support in the record, that these instances constitute a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of those cases in which women prefer not to notify their husbands (and do not qualify for an exception). <i>Ante,</i> at 895. This assumption is not based on any hard evidence, however. And were it helpful to an attempt to reach a desired result, one could just as easily assume that the battered women situations form 100 percent of the cases where women desire not to notify, or that they constitute only 20 percent of those cases. But reliance on such speculation is the necessary result of adopting the undue burden standard.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The definition in use at that time provided as follows:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"`Medical emergency.'That condition which, on the basis of the physician's best clinical judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitate the immediate abortion of same to avert the death of the mother or for which a 24-hour delay will create grave peril of immediate and irreversible loss of major bodily function.\\\\\\\" Pa. Stat.Ann., Tit.18, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3203(Purdon 1983).</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  The Court's suggestion, <i>ante,</i> at 847-848, that adherence to tradition would require us to uphold laws against interracial marriage is entirely wrong. Any tradition in that case was contradicted <i>by a text</i> \\u00c2\\u2014an Equal Protection Clause that explicitly establishes racial equality as a constitutional value. See <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 9 (1967) (\\\\\\\"In the case at bar, . . . we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race\\\\\\\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 13 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). The enterprise launched in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), by contrast, sought to <i>establish</i> \\u00c2\\u2014in the teeth of a clear, contrary tradition\\u00c2\\u2014a value found nowhere in the constitutional text.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>There is, of course, no comparable tradition barring recognition of a \\\\\\\"liberty interest\\\\\\\" in carrying one's child to term free from state efforts to kill it. For that reason, it does not follow that the Constitution does not protect childbirth simply because it does not protect abortion. The Court's contention, <i>ante,</i> at 859, that the only way to protect childbirth is to protect abortion shows the utter bankruptcy of constitutional analysis deprived of tradition as a validating factor.It drives one to say that the only way to protect the right to eat is to acknowledge the constitutional right to starve oneself to death.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  Justice Blackmun's parade of adjectives is similarly empty: Abortion is among \\\\\\\"`the most intimate and personal choices,' \\\\\\\"<i>ante,</i> at 923; it is a matter \\\\\\\"central to personal dignity and autonomy,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.;</i> and it involves \\\\\\\"personal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity,identity,and destiny,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 927.Justice Stevens is not much less conclusory: The decision to choose abortion is a matter of \\\\\\\"the highest privacy and the most personal nature,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 915; it involves a \\\\\\\"`difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to [a woman's] future,' \\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 916; the authority to make this \\\\\\\"traumatic and yet empowering decisio[n]\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\"an element of basic human dignity,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.;</i> and it is \\\\\\\"nothing less than a matter of conscience,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The joint opinion is clearly wrong in asserting, <i>ante,</i> at 874, that \\\\\\\"the Court's early abortion cases adhered to\\\\\\\" the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard. The passing use of that phrase in Justice Blackmun's opinion for the Court in <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976) <i>(Bellotti I)</i><i>,</i> was not by way of setting forth the <i>standard</i> of unconstitutionality, as Justice O'Connor's later opinions did, but by way of expressing the <i>conclusion</i> of unconstitutionality. Justice Powell for a time appeared to employ a variant of \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" analysis in several non majority opinions, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 443 U. S. 622, 647 (1979) <i>(Bellotti II)</i><i>; </i><i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678, 705 (1977) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but he too ultimately rejected that standard in his opinion for the Court in <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 420, n. 1 (1983) <i>(Akron I)</i> . The joint opinion's reliance on <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977), and <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980), is entirely misplaced, since those cases did not involve regulation of abortion, but mere refusal to fund it. In any event, Justice O'Connor's earlier formulations have apparently now proved unsatisfactory to the three Justices, who\\u00c2\\u2014in the name of <i>stare decisis</i> no less\\u00c2\\u2014today find it necessary to devise an entirely new version of \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" analysis. See <i>ante,</i> at 877-879.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  The joint opinion further asserts that a law imposing an undue burden on abortion decisions is not a \\\\\\\"permissible\\\\\\\" means of serving \\\\\\\"legitimate\\\\\\\" state interests. <i>Ante,</i> at 877. This description of the undue burden standard in terms more commonly associated with the rational-basis test will come as a surprise even to those who have followed closely our wanderings in this forsaken wilderness. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Akron I, supra,</i> at 463 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"The `undue burden' . . . represents the required threshold inquiry that must be conducted before this Court can require a State to justify its legislative actions under the exacting `compelling state interest' standard\\\\\\\"); see also <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i> 497 U. S. 417, 458-460 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). This confusing equation of the two standards is apparently designed to explain how one of the Justices who joined the plurality opinion in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989), which adopted the rational-basis test, could join an opinion expressly adopting the undue burden test. See <i>id.,</i> at 520 (rejecting the view that abortion is a \\\\\\\"fundamental right,\\\\\\\" instead inquiring whether a law regulating the woman's \\\\\\\"liberty interest\\\\\\\" in abortion is \\\\\\\"reasonably designed\\\\\\\" to further \\\\\\\"legitimate\\\\\\\" state ends). The same motive also apparently underlies the joint opinion's erroneous citation of the plurality opinion in <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health,</i> 497 U. S. 502, 506 (1990) <i>(Akron II)</i> (opinion of Kennedy, J.), as applying the undue burden test. See <i>ante,</i> at 876 (using this citation to support the proposition that \\\\\\\"two of us\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014<i>i. e.,</i> two of the authors of the joint opinion\\u00c2\\u2014have previously applied this test). In fact, <i>Akron II</i> does not mention the undue burden standard until the conclusion of the opinion, when it states that the statute at issue \\\\\\\"does not impose an undue, <i>or otherwise unconstitutional,</i> burden.\\\\\\\" 497 U. S., at 519 (emphasis added). I fail to see how anyone can think that saying a statute does not impose an unconstitutional burden under <i>any</i> standard, including the undue burden test, amounts to adopting the undue burden test as the <i>exclusive</i> standard. The Court's citation of <i>Hodgson</i> as reflecting Justice Kennedy's and Justice O'Connor's \\\\\\\"shared premises,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 878, is similarly inexplicable, since the word \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\" was never even used in the former's opinion in that case.I joined Justice Kennedy's opinions in both <i>Hodgson</i> and <i>Akron II;</i> I should be grateful, I suppose, that the joint opinion does not claim that I, too, have adopted the undue burden test.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  Of course Justice O'Connor was correct in her former view. The arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \\\\\\\"can in reason and all fairness\\\\\\\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. <i>Ante,</i> at 870. Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  The joint opinion is not entirely faithful to this principle, however. In approving the District Court's factual findings with respect to the spousal notice provision, it relies extensively on nonrecord materials, and in reliance upon them adds a number of factual conclusions of its own. <i>Ante,</i> at 891-893. Because this additional factfinding pertains to matters that surely are \\\\\\\"subject to reasonable dispute,\\\\\\\" Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b), the joint opinion must be operating on the premise that these are \\\\\\\"legislative\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\"adjudicative\\\\\\\" facts, see Rule 201(a). But if a court can find an undue burden simply by selectively string-citing the right social science articles, I do not see the point of emphasizing or requiring \\\\\\\"detailed factual findings\\\\\\\" in the District Court.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  Justice Blackmun's effort to preserve as much of <i>Roe</i> as possible leads him to read the joint opinion as more \\\\\\\"constan[t]\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"steadfast\\\\\\\" than can be believed. He contends that the joint opinion's \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" standard requires the application of strict scrutiny to \\\\\\\"all non-<i>de-minimis</i> \\\\\\\" abortion regulations, <i>ante,</i> at 926, but that could only be true if a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 877 (joint opinion), were the same thing as a non<i>de-minimis</i> obstacle\\u00c2\\u2014which it plainly is not.</p>\\\\n\\\\n</div>\\\",\"}], \"response_format\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"CaseName\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"DateOfDecision\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"CourtJurisdiction\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"StateOrCircuit\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"JudgesOnBench\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"Question6\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsUnconstitutionalStatementPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsUnconstitutionalStatementPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"Question9\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsExceedingAuthorityClaimPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsExceedingAuthorityClaimPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"Question12\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsMoralEthicalOppositionPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsMoralEthicalOppositionPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"ReasonForCitingRoe\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"SummaryOpinions\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"Majority\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"Dissenting\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"Concurring\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"Majority\"]}, \"LegislativeActionRecommendations\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreRecommendationsPresent\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"AreRecommendationsPresent\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"PublicOpinionAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsPublicOpinionMentioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsPublicOpinionMentioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"PrecedentReferences\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreOtherPrecedentsReferenced\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Precedents\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"TreatmentOfRoe\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"AreOtherPrecedentsReferenced\", \"Precedents\"]}, \"OutcomeOrHolding\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"RoeAuthorityAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsRoeBindingPersuasiveQuestioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"OpinionType\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"IsRoeBindingPersuasiveQuestioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"OtherConstitutionalGrounds\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}, \"LegislativeDebatesAnalysis\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"AreDebatesMentioned\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Excerpts\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"AreDebatesMentioned\", \"Excerpts\"]}, \"FutureOutlook\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"IsFutureOutlookSuggested\": {\"type\": \"boolean\"}, \"Notes\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"IsFutureOutlookSuggested\"]}, \"AdditionalObservations\": {\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"]}}, \"required\": [\"CaseName\", \"DateOfDecision\", \"CourtJurisdiction\", \"StateOrCircuit\", \"JudgesOnBench\", \"Question6\", \"Question9\", \"Question12\", \"SummaryOpinions\", \"LegislativeActionRecommendations\", \"PublicOpinionAnalysis\", \"PrecedentReferences\", \"OutcomeOrHolding\", \"RoeAuthorityAnalysis\", \"OtherConstitutionalGrounds\", \"LegislativeDebatesAnalysis\", \"FutureOutlook\"]}}}\n",

JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\\\\n<p>This case is a logical and anticipated corollary to <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179 (1973), for it raises issues secondary to those that were then before the Court. Indeed, some of the questions now presented were forecast and reserved in <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe.</i> 410 U. S., at 165 n. 67.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>After the decisions in <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe,</i> this Court remanded for reconsideration a pending Missouri federal case in which the State's then-existing abortion legislation, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*56</span> Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 559.100, 542.380, and 563.300 (1969), was under constitutional challenge. <i>Rodgers</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 410 U. S. 949 (1973). A three-judge federal court for the Western District of Missouri, in an unreported decision, thereafter declared the challenged Missouri statutes unconstitutional and granted injunctive relief. On appeal here, that judgment was summarily affirmed. <i>Danforth</i> v. <i>Rodgers,</i> 414 U. S. 1035 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>In June 1974, somewhat more than a year after <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe</i> had been decided, Missouri's 77th General Assembly, in its Second Regular Session, enacted House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereinafter Act). The legislation was approved by the Governor on June 14, 1974, and became effective immediately by reason of an emergency clause contained in \\u00c2\\u00a7 A of the statute. The Act is set forth in full as the Appendix to this opinion. It imposes a structure for the control and regulation of abortions in Missouri during all stages of pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Three days after the Act became effective, the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri, a not-for-profit Missouri corporation which maintains a facility in Columbia, Mo., for the performance of abortions; David Hall, M. D.; and Michael Freiman, M. D. Doctor Hall is a resident of Columbia, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is chairman of the Department and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Missouri Medical School at Columbia, and supervises abortions at the Planned Parenthood facility. He was described by the three-judge court in the 1973 case as one of four plaintiffs who were \\\\\\\"eminent, Missouri-licensed obstetricians and gynecologists.\\\\\\\" Jurisdictional <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*57</span> Statement, App. A7, in <i>Danforth</i> v. <i>Rodgers</i><i>,</i> No. 73-426, O. T. 1973. Doctor Freiman is a resident of St. Louis, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is an instructor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University Medical School, and performs abortions at two St. Louis hospitals and at a clinic in that city.</p>\\\\n<p>The named defendants are the Attorney General of Missouri and the Circuit Attorney of the city of St. Louis \\\\\\\"in his representative capacity\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"as the representative of the class of all similar Prosecuting Attorneys of the various counties of the State of Missouri.\\\\\\\" Complaint 10.</p>\\\\n<p>The plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and, purportedly, \\\\\\\"on behalf of the entire class consisting of duly licensed physicians and surgeons presently performing or desiring to perform the termination of pregnancies and on behalf of the entire class consisting of their patients desiring the termination of pregnancy, all within the State of Missouri.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 9. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and also sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act on the ground, among others, that certain of its provisions deprived them and their patients of various constitutional rights: \\\\\\\"the right to privacy in the physician-patient relationship\\\\\\\"; the physicians' \\\\\\\"right to practice medicine according to the highest standards of medical practice\\\\\\\"; the female patients' right to determine whether to bear children; the patients' \\\\\\\"right to life due to the inherent risk involved in childbirth\\\\\\\" or in medical procedures alternative to abortion; the physicians' \\\\\\\"right to give and plaintiffs' patients' right to receive safe and adequate medical advice and treatment, pertaining to the decision of whether to carry a given pregnancy to term and the method of termination\\\\\\\"; the patients' right under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment \\\\\\\"by forcing <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*58</span> and coercing them to bear each pregnancy they conceive\\\\\\\"; and, by being placed \\\\\\\"in the position of decision making beset with . . . inherent possibilities of bias and conflict of interest,\\\\\\\" the physician's right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 10-11.</p>\\\\n<p>The particular provisions of the Act that remained under specific challenge at the end of trial were \\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2), defining the term \\\\\\\"viability\\\\\\\"; \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2), requiring from the woman, prior to submitting to abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a certification in writing that she consents to the procedure and \\\\\\\"that her consent is informed and freely given and is not the result of coercion\\\\\\\"; \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3), requiring, for the same period, \\\\\\\"the written consent of the woman's spouse, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother\\\\\\\"; \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4), requiring, for the same period, \\\\\\\"the written consent of one parent or person in loco parentis of the woman if the woman is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother\\\\\\\"; \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care \\\\\\\"to preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\\\\\" and, failing such, deeming him guilty of manslaughter and making him liable in an action for damages; \\u00c2\\u00a7 7, declaring an infant, who survives \\\\\\\"an attempted abortion which was not performed to save the life or health of the mother,\\\\\\\" to be \\\\\\\"an abandoned ward of the state under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,\\\\\\\" and depriving the mother, and also the father if the consented to the abortion, of parental rights; \\u00c2\\u00a7 9, the legislative finding that the method of abortion known as saline amniocentesis \\\\\\\"is deleterious to maternal health,\\\\\\\" and prohibiting that method after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; and \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 10 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*59</span> and 11, imposing reporting and maintenance of record requirements for health facilities and for physicians who perform abortions.</p>\\\\n<p>The case was presented to a three-judge District Court convened pursuant to the provisions of 28 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 2281 and 2284. 392 F. Supp. 1362 (1975). The court ruled that the two physician-plaintiffs had standing inasmuch as \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) provides that the physician who fails to exercise the prescribed standard of professional care due the fetus in the abortion procedure shall be guilty of manslaughter, and \\u00c2\\u00a7 14 provides that any person who performs or aids in the performance of an abortion contrary to the provisions of the Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 392 F. Supp., at 1366-1367. Due to this \\\\\\\"obvious standing\\\\\\\" of the two physicians, <i>id.,</i> at 1367, the court deemed it unnecessary to determine whether Planned Parenthood also had standing.</p>\\\\n<p>On the issues as to the constitutionality of the several challenged sections of the Act, the District Court, largely by a divided vote, ruled that all except the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) withstood the attack. That sentence was held to be constitutionally impermissible because it imposed upon the physician the duty to exercise at all stages of pregnancy \\\\\\\"that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\\\\\" that \\\\\\\"would be required . . . to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born.\\\\\\\" Inasmuch as this failed to exclude the stage of pregnancy prior to viability, the provision was \\\\\\\"unconstitutionally overbroad.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1371.</p>\\\\n<p>One judge concurred in part and dissented in part. <i>Id.,</i> at 1374. He agreed with the majority as to the constitutionality of \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2), 3 (2), 10, and 11, respectively relating to the definition of \\\\\\\"viability,\\\\\\\" the woman's prior written consent, maintenance of records, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*60</span> and retention of records. He also agreed with the majority that \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) was unconstitutionally overbroad. He dissented from the majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3), 3 (4), 7, and 9, relating, respectively, to spousal consent, parental consent, the termination of parental rights, and the proscription of saline amniocentesis.</p>\\\\n<p>In No. 74-1151, the plaintiffs appeal from that part of the District Court's judgment upholding sections of the Act as constitutional and denying injunctive relief against their application and enforcement. In No. 74-1419, the defendant Attorney General cross-appeals from that part of the judgment holding \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) unconstitutional and enjoining enforcement thereof. We granted the plaintiffs' application for stay of enforcement of the Act pending appeal. 420 U. S. 918 (1975). Probable jurisdiction of both appeals thereafter was noted. 423 U. S. 819 (1975).</p>\\\\n<p>For convenience, we shall usually refer to the plaintiffs as \\\\\\\"appellants\\\\\\\" and to both named defendants as \\\\\\\"appellees.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> the Court concluded that the \\\\\\\"right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 153. It emphatically rejected, however, the proffered argument \\\\\\\"that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Instead, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*61</span> this right \\\\\\\"must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 154.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court went on to say that the \\\\\\\"pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy,\\\\\\\" for she \\\\\\\"carries an embryo and, later, a fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 159. It was therefore \\\\\\\"reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court stressed the measure of the State's interest in \\\\\\\"the light of present medical knowledge.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163. It concluded that the permissibility of state regulation was to be viewed in three stages: \\\\\\\"For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician,\\\\\\\" without interference from the State. <i>Id.,</i> at 164. The participation by the attending physician in the abortion decision, and his responsibility in that decision, thus, were emphasized. After the first stage, as so described, the State may, if it chooses, reasonably regulate the abortion procedure to preserve and protect maternal health. <i>Ibid.</i> Finally, for the stage subsequent to viability, a point purposefully left flexible for professional determination, and dependent upon developing medical skill and technical ability,<sup>[1]</sup> the State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. <i>Id.,</i> at 163-165.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*62</span> IV</h2>\\\\n<p>With the exception specified in n. 2, <i>infra,</i> we agree with the District Court that the physician-appellants clearly have standing. This was established in <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S., at 188. Like the Georgia statutes challenged in that case, \\\\\\\"[t]he physician is the one against whom [the Missouri Act] directly operate[s] in the event he procures an abortion that does not meet the statutory exceptions and conditions. The physician-appellants, therefore, assert a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment. They should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.\\\\\\\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>Our primary task, then, is to consider each of the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*63</span> challenged provisions of the new Missouri abortion statute in the particular light of the opinions and decisions in <i>Roe</i> and in <i>Doe.</i> To this we now turn, with the assistance of helpful briefs from both sides and from some of the <i>amici.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p><i>The definition of viability.</i> Section 2 (2) of the Act defines \\\\\\\"viability\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems.\\\\\\\" Appellants claim that this definition violates and conflicts with the discussion of viability in our opinion in <i>Roe.</i> 410 U. S., at 160, 163. In particular, appellants object to the failure of the definition to contain any reference to a gestational time period, to its failure to incorporate and reflect the three stages of pregnancy, to the presence of the word \\\\\\\"indefinitely,\\\\\\\" and to the extra burden of regulation imposed. It is suggested that the definition expands the Court's definition of viability, as expressed in <i>Roe,</i> and amounts to a legislative determination of what is properly a matter for medical judgment. It is said that the \\\\\\\"mere possibility of momentary survival is not the medical standard of viability.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellants 67.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe,</i> we used the term \\\\\\\"viable,\\\\\\\" properly we thought, to signify the point at which the fetus is \\\\\\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,\\\\\\\" and presumably capable of \\\\\\\"meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 160, 163. We noted that this point \\\\\\\"is usually placed\\\\\\\" at about seven months or 28 weeks, but may occur earlier. <i>Id.,</i> at 160.</p>\\\\n<p>We agree with the District Court and conclude that the definition of viability in the Act does not conflict with what was said and held in <i>Roe.</i> In fact, we believe that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*64</span> \\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2), even when read in conjunction with \\u00c2\\u00a7 5 (proscribing an abortion \\\\\\\"not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother . . . unless the attending physician first certifies with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable\\\\\\\"), the constitutionality of which is not explicitly challenged here, reflects an attempt on the part of the Missouri General Assembly to comply with our observations and discussion in <i>Roe</i> relating to viability. Appellant Hall, in his deposition, had no particular difficulty with the statutory definition.<sup>[3]</sup> As noted above, we recognized in <i>Roe</i> that viability was a matter of medical judgment, skill, and technical ability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term. Section 2 (2) does the same. Indeed, one might argue, as the appellees do, that the presence of the statute's words \\\\\\\"continued indefinitely\\\\\\\" favor, rather than disfavor, the appellants, for, arguably, the point when life can be \\\\\\\"continued indefinitely outside the womb\\\\\\\" may well occur later in pregnancy than the point where the fetus is \\\\\\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 160.</p>\\\\n<p>In any event, we agree with the District Court that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability, which essentially is a medical concept, at a specific point in the gestation period. The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician. The definition of viability in \\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2) merely reflects this fact. The appellees do not contend otherwise, for they insist <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*65</span> that the determination of viability rests with the physician in the exercise of his professional judgment.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>We thus do not accept appellants' contention that a specified number of weeks in pregnancy must be fixed by statute as the point of viability. See <i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp. 631, 637 (WD Ky. 1974); <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Anderson,</i> 378 F. Supp. 1008, 1016 (Minn. 1974), dismissed for want of jurisdiction <i>sub nom. </i><i>Spannaus</i> v. <i>Hodgson,</i> 420 U. S. 903 (1975).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>We conclude that the definition in \\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2) of the Act does not circumvent the limitations on state regulation outlined in <i>Roe.</i> We therefore hold that the Act's definition of \\\\\\\"viability\\\\\\\" comports with <i>Roe</i> and withstands the constitutional attack made upon it in this litigation.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p><i>The woman's consent.</i> Under \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2) of the Act, a woman, prior to submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, must certify in writing her consent to the procedure and \\\\\\\"that her consent is informed and freely given and is not the result of coercion.\\\\\\\" Appellants argue that this requirement is violative of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*66</span> <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 164-165, by imposing an extra layer and burden of regulation on the abortion decision. See <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S., at 195-200. Appellants also claim that the provision is overbroad and vague.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court's majority relied on the propositions that the decision to terminate a pregnancy, of course, \\\\\\\"is often a stressful one,\\\\\\\" and that the consent requirement of \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2) \\\\\\\"insures that the pregnant woman retains control over the discretions of her consulting physician.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1368, 1369. The majority also felt that the consent requirement \\\\\\\"does not single out the abortion procedure, but merely includes it within the category of medical operations for which consent is required.\\\\\\\"<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 1369. The third judge joined the majority in upholding \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2), but added that the written consent requirement was \\\\\\\"not burdensome or chilling\\\\\\\" and manifested \\\\\\\"a legitimate interest of the state that this important decision has in fact been made by the person constitutionally empowered to do so.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1374. He went on to observe that the requirement \\\\\\\"in no way interposes the state or third parties in the decision-making process.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1375.</p>\\\\n<p>We do not disagree with the result reached by the District Court as to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2). It is true that <i>Doe</i> and <i>Roe</i> clearly establish that the State may not restrict the decision of the patient and her physician regarding abortion during the first stage of pregnancy. Despite the fact that apparently no other Missouri statute, with the exceptions referred to in n. 6, <i>supra,</i> requires a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*67</span> patient's prior written consent to a surgical procedure,<sup>[7]</sup> the imposition by \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2) of such a requirement for termination of pregnancy even during the first stage, in our view, is not in itself an unconstitutional requirement. The decision to abort, indeed, is an important, and often a stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences. The woman is the one primarily concerned, and her awareness of the decision and its significance may be assured, constitutionally, by the State to the extent of requiring her prior written consent.</p>\\\\n<p>We could not say that a requirement imposed by the State that a prior written consent for any surgery would be unconstitutional. As a consequence, we see no constitutional defect in requiring it only for some types of surgery as, for example, an intracardiac procedure, or where the surgical risk is elevated above a specified mortality level, or, for that matter, for abortions.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p><i>The spouse's consent.</i> Section 3 (3) requires the prior written consent of the spouse of the woman seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*68</span> \\\\\\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.\\\\\\\"<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The appellees defend \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) on the ground that it was enacted in the light of the General Assembly's \\\\\\\"perception of marriage as an institution,\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellee Danforth 34, and that any major change in family status is a decision to be made jointly by the marriage partners. Reference is made to an abortion's possible effect on the woman's childbearing potential. It is said that marriage always has entailed some legislatively imposed limitations: Reference is made to adultery and bigamy as criminal offenses; to Missouri's general requirement, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 453.030.3 (1969), that for an adoption of a child born in wedlock the consent of both parents is necessary; to similar joint-consent requirements imposed by a number of States with respect to artificial insemination and the legitimacy of children so conceived; to the laws of two States requiring spousal consent for voluntary sterilization; and to the long-established requirement of spousal consent for the effective disposition of an interest in real property. It is argued that \\\\\\\"[r]ecognizing that the consent of both parties is generally necessary. . . to begin a family, the legislature has determined that a change in the family structure set in motion by mutual consent should be terminated only by mutual consent,\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellee Danforth 38, and that what the legislature did was to exercise its inherent policy-making power \\\\\\\"for what was believed to be in the best interests of all the people of Missouri.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 40.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellants, on the other hand, contend that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) obviously is designed to afford the husband the right unilaterally to prevent or veto an abortion, whether or <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*69</span> not he is the father of the fetus, and that this not only violates <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe</i> but is also in conflict with other decided cases. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Poe</i> v. <i>Gerstein,</i> 517 F. 2d 787, 794-796 (CA5 1975), appeal docketed, No. 75-713; <i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp., at 636-637; <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Rampton,</i> 366 F. Supp. 189, 193 (Utah 1973). They also refer to the situation where the husband's consent cannot be obtained because he cannot be located. And they assert that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) is vague and overbroad.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe</i> we specifically reserved decision on the question whether a requirement for consent by the father of the fetus, by the spouse, or by the parents, or a parent, of an unmarried minor, may be constitutionally imposed. 410 U. S., at 165 n. 67. We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) of the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case, and with the courts whose decisions are cited above, that the State cannot \\\\\\\"delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1375. Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, to prevent abortion during that same period.</p>\\\\n<p>We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying. Neither has this Court failed to appreciate the importance of the marital relationship in our society. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, 486 (1965); <i>Maynard</i> v. <i>Hill,</i> 125 U. S. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*70</span> 190, 211 (1888).<sup>[10]</sup> Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forgo an abortion may have profound effects on the future of any marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious. Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy, when the State itself lacks that right. See <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972).<sup>[11]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*71</span> It seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband. No marriage may be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue. But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all. Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all. likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the \\\\\\\"interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1370.</p>\\\\n<p>We recognize, of course, that when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. The obvious fact is that when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor. Cf. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 153.</p>\\\\n<p>We conclude that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) of the Missouri Act is inconsistent with the standards enunciated in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 164-165, and is unconstitutional. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the appellants' <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*72</span> additional challenges to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) based on vagueness and overbreadth.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>D</h2>\\\\n<p><i>Parental Consent.</i> Section 3 (4) requires, with respect to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, where the woman is unmarried and under the age of 18 years, the written consent of a parent or person <i>in loco parentis</i> unless, again, \\\\\\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.\\\\\\\" It is to be observed that only one parent need consent.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellees defend the statute in several ways. They point out that the law properly may subject minors to more stringent limitations than are permissible with respect to adults, and they cite, among other cases, <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S. 158 (1944), and <i>McKeiver</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania,</i> 403 U. S. 528 (1971). Missouri law, it is said, \\\\\\\"is replete with provisions reflecting the interest of the state in assuring the welfare of minors,\\\\\\\" citing statutes relating to a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a court proceeding, to the care of delinquent and neglected children, to child labor, and to compulsory education. Brief for Appellee Danforth 42. Certain decisions are considered by the State to be outside the scope of a minor's ability to act in his own best interest or in the interest of the public, citing statutes proscribing the sale of firearms and deadly weapons to minors without parental consent, and other statutes relating to minors' exposure to certain types of literature, the purchase by pawnbrokers of property from minors, and the sale of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to minors. It is pointed out that the record contains testimony to the effect that children of tender years (even ages 10 and 11) have sought abortions. Thus, a State's permitting a child to obtain an abortion without the counsel of an adult \\\\\\\"who has responsibility <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*73</span> or concern for the child would constitute an irresponsible abdication of the State's duty to protect the welfare of minors.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 44. Parental discretion, too, has been protected from unwarranted or unreasonable interference from the State, citing <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> 262 U. S. 390 (1923); <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510 (1925); <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Yoder,</i> 406 U. S. 205 (1972). Finally, it is said that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4) imposes no additional burden on the physician because even prior to the passage of the Act the physician would require parental consent before performing an abortion on a minor.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellants, in their turn, emphasize that no other Missouri statute specifically requires the additional consent of a minor's parent for medical or surgical treatment, and that in Missouri a minor legally may consent to medical services for pregnancy (excluding abortion), venereal disease, and drug abuse. Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 431.061-431.063 (Supp. 1975). The result of \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4), it is said, \\\\\\\"is the ultimate supremacy of the parents' desires over those of the minor child, the pregnant patient.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellants 93. It is noted that in Missouri a woman under the age of 18 who marries with parental consent does not require parental consent to abort, and yet her contemporary who has chosen not to marry must obtain parental approval.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court majority recognized that, in contrast to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3), the State's interest in protecting the mutuality of a marriage relationship is not present with respect to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4). It found \\\\\\\"a compelling basis,\\\\\\\" however, in the State's interest \\\\\\\"in safeguarding the authority of the family relationship.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1370. The dissenting judge observed that one could not seriously argue that a minor must submit to an abortion if her parents insist, and he could not see \\\\\\\"why she would not be entitled to the same right of self-determination now <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*74</span> explicitly accorded to adult women, provided she is sufficiently mature to understand the procedure and to make an intelligent assessment of her circumstances with the advice of her physician.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1376.</p>\\\\n<p>Of course, much of what has been said above, with respect to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3), applies with equal force to \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4). Other courts that have considered the parental-consent issue in the light of <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe,</i> have concluded that a statute like \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4) does not withstand constitutional scrutiny. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Poe</i> v. <i>Gerstein,</i> 517 F. 2d, at 792; <i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp., at 636-637; <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Rampton,</i> 366 F. Supp., at 193, 199; <i>State</i> v. <i>Koome,</i> 84 Wash. 2d 901, 530 P. 2d 260 (1975).</p>\\\\n<p>We agree with appellants and with the courts whose decisions have just been cited that the State may not impose a blanket provision, such as \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4), requiring the consent of a parent or person <i>in loco parentis</i> as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy. Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.</p>\\\\n<p>Constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Breed</i> v. <i>Jones,</i> 421 U. S. 519 (1975); <i>Goss</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 419 U. S. 565 (1975); <i>Tinker</i> v. <i>Des Moines School Dist.,</i> 393 U. S. 503 (1969); <i>In re Gault,</i> 387 U. S. 1 (1967). The Court indeed, however, long has recognized that the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*75</span> <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S., at 170; <i>Ginsberg</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 390 U. S. 629 (1968). It remains, then, to examine whether there is any significant state interest in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent or person <i>in loco parentis</i> that is not present in the case of an adult.</p>\\\\n<p>One suggested interest is the safeguarding of the family unit and of parental authority. 392 F. Supp., at 1370. It is difficult, however, to conclude that providing a parent with absolute power to overrule a determination, made by the physician and his minor patient, to terminate the patient's pregnancy will serve to strengthen the family unit. Neither is it likely that such veto power will enhance parental authority or control where the minor and the nonconsenting parent are so fundamentally in conflict and the very existence of the pregnancy already has fractured the family structure. Any independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter's pregnancy is no more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant.</p>\\\\n<p>We emphasize that our holding that \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4) is invalid does not suggest that every minor, regardless of age or maturity, may give effective consent for termination of her pregnancy. See <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird, post,</i> p. 132. The fault with \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4) is that it imposes a special-consent provision, exercisable by a person other than the woman and her physician, as a prerequisite to a minor's termination of her pregnancy and does so without a sufficient justification for the restriction. It violates the strictures of <i>Roe</i> and <i>Doe.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>E</h2>\\\\n<p><i>Saline amniocentesis.</i> Section 9 of the statute prohibits the use of saline amniocentesis, as a method or technique of abortion, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*76</span> It describes the method as one whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and \\\\\\\"a saline or other fluid\\\\\\\" is inserted into the amniotic sac. The statute imposes this proscription on the ground that the technique \\\\\\\"is deleterious to maternal health,\\\\\\\" and places it in the form of a legislative finding. Appellants challenge this provision on the ground that it operates to preclude virtually all abortions after the first trimester. This is so, it is claimed, because a substantial percentage, in the neighborhood of 70% according to the testimony, of all abortions performed in the United States after the first trimester are effected through the procedure of saline amniocentesis. Appellants stress the fact that the alternative methods of hysterotomy and hysterectomy are significantly more dangerous and critical for the woman than the saline technique; they also point out that the mortality rate for normal childbirth exceeds that where saline amniocentesis is employed. Finally, appellants note that the perhaps safer alternative of prostaglandin instillation, suggested and strongly relied upon by the appellees, at least at the time of the trial, is not yet widely used in this country.</p>\\\\n<p>We held in <i>Roe</i> that after the first stage, \\\\\\\"the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 164. The question with respect to \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 therefore is whether the flat prohibition of saline amniocentesis is a restriction which \\\\\\\"reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 163. The appellees urge that what the Missouri General Assembly has done here is consistent with that guideline and is buttressed by substantial supporting medical evidence in the record to which this Court should defer.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*77</span> The District Court's majority determined, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the maternal mortality rate in childbirth does, indeed, exceed the mortality rate where saline amniocentesis is used. Therefore, the majority acknowledged, \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 could be upheld only if there were safe alternative methods of inducing abortion after the first 12 weeks. 392 F. Supp., at 1373. Referring to such methods as hysterotomy, hysterectomy, \\\\\\\"mechanical means of inducing abortion,\\\\\\\" and prostaglandin injection, the majority said that at least the latter two techniques were safer than saline. Consequently, the majority concluded, the restriction in \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 could be upheld as reasonably related to maternal health.</p>\\\\n<p>We feel that the majority, in reaching its conclusion, failed to appreciate and to consider several significant facts. First, it did not recognize the prevalence, as the record conclusively demonstrates, of the use of saline amniocentesis as an accepted medical procedure in this country; the procedure, as noted above, is employed in a substantial majority (the testimony from both sides ranges from 68% to 80%) of all post-first-trimester abortions. Second, it failed to recognize that at the time of trial, there were severe limitations on the availability of the prostaglandin technique, which, although promising, was used only on an experimental basis until less than two years before. See <i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp., at 637, where it was said that at that time (1974), there were \\\\\\\"no physicians in Kentucky competent in the technique of prostaglandin amnio infusion.\\\\\\\" And appellees offered no evidence that prostaglandin abortions were available in Missouri.<sup>[12]</sup> Third, the statute's <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*78</span> reference to the insertion of \\\\\\\"a saline or other fluid\\\\\\\" appears to include within its proscription the intra-amniotic injection of prostaglandin itself and other methods that may be developed in the future and that may prove highly effective and completely safe. Finally, the majority did not consider the anomaly inherent in \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 when it proscribes the use of saline but does not prohibit techniques that are many times more likely to result in maternal death. See 392 F. Supp., at 1378 n. 8 (dissenting opinion).</p>\\\\n<p>These unappreciated or overlooked factors place the State's decision to bar use of the saline method in a completely different light. The State, through \\u00c2\\u00a7 9, would prohibit the use of a method which the record shows is the one most commonly used nationally by physicians after the first trimester and which is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even continuation of the pregnancy until normal childbirth. Moreover, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*79</span> as a practical matter, it forces a woman and her physician to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than the method outlawed.</p>\\\\n<p>As so viewed, particularly in the light of the present unavailability\\u00c2\\u2014as demonstrated by the record\\u00c2\\u2014of the prostaglandin technique, the outright legislative proscription of saline fails as a reasonable regulation for the protection of maternal health. It comes into focus, instead, as an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks. As such, it does not withstand constitutional challenge. See <i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp., at 637.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>F</h2>\\\\n<p><i>Recordkeeping.</i> Sections 10 and 11 of the Act impose recordkeeping requirements for health facilities and physicians concerned with abortions irrespective of the pregnancy stage. Under \\u00c2\\u00a7 10, each such facility and physician is to be supplied with forms \\\\\\\"the purpose and function of which shall be the preservation of maternal health and life by adding to the sum of medical knowledge through the compilation of relevant maternal health and life data and to monitor all abortions performed to assure that they are done only under and in accordance with the provisions of the law.\\\\\\\" The statute states that the information on the forms \\\\\\\"shall be confidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes.\\\\\\\" The \\\\\\\"records, however, may be inspected and health data acquired by local, state, or national public health officers.\\\\\\\" Under \\u00c2\\u00a7 11 the records are to be kept for seven years in the permanent files of the health facility where the abortion was performed.</p>\\\\n<p>Appellants object to these reporting and recordkeeping provisions on the ground that they, too, impose an extra <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*80</span> layer and burden of regulation, and that they apply throughout all stages of pregnancy. All the judges of the District Court panel, however, viewed these provisions as statistical requirements \\\\\\\"essential to the advancement of medical knowledge,\\\\\\\" and as nothing that would \\\\\\\"restrict either the abortion decision itself or the exercise of medical judgment in performing an abortion.\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp., at 1374.</p>\\\\n<p>One may concede that there are important and perhaps conflicting interests affected by recordkeeping requirements. On the one hand, maintenance of records indeed may be helpful in developing information pertinent to the preservation of maternal health. On the other hand, as we stated in <i>Roe,</i> during the first stage of pregnancy the State may impose no restrictions or regulations governing the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician with respect to the termination of her pregnancy. 410 U. S., at 163, 164. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that one reason for the recordkeeping requirement, namely, to assure that all abortions in Missouri are performed in accordance with the Act, fades somewhat into insignificance in view of our holding above as to spousal and parental consent requirements.</p>\\\\n<p>Recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible. This surely is so for the period after the first stage of pregnancy, for then the State may enact substantive as well as recordkeeping regulations that are reasonable means of protecting maternal health. As to the first stage, one may argue forcefully, as the appellants do, that the State should not be able to impose any recordkeeping requirements that significantly differ from those imposed with respect to other, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*81</span> and comparable, medical or surgical procedures. We conclude, however, that the provisions of \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 10 and 11, while perhaps approaching impermissible limits, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves. Recordkeeping of this kind, if not abused or overdone, can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens, and may be a resource that is relevant to decisions involving medical experience and judgment.<sup>[13]</sup> The added requirements for confidentiality, with the sole exception for public health officers, and for retention for seven years, a period not unreasonable in length, assist and persuade us in our determination of the constitutional limits. As so regarded, we see no legally significant impact or consequence on the abortion decision or on the physician-patient relationship. We naturally assume, furthermore, that these recordkeeping and record-maintaining provisions will be interpreted and enforced by Missouri's Division of Health in the light of our decision with respect to the Act's other provisions, and that, of course, they will not be utilized in such a way as to accomplish, through the sheer burden of recordkeeping detail, what we have held to be an otherwise unconstitutional restriction. Obviously, the State may not require execution of spousal and parental consent forms that have been invalidated today.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>G</h2>\\\\n<p><i>Standard of care.</i> Appellee Danforth in No. 74-1419 appeals from the unanimous decision of the District <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*82</span> Court that \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) of the Act is unconstitutional. That section provides:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. . . . Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages.\\\\\\\"</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court held that the first sentence was unconstitutionally overbroad because it failed to exclude from its reach the stage of pregnancy prior to viability. 392 F. Supp., at 1371.</p>\\\\n<p>The Attorney General argues that the District Court's interpretation is erroneous and unnecessary. He claims that the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) establishes only the general standard of care that applies to the person who performs the abortion, and that the second sentence describes the circumstances when that standard of care applies, namely, when a live child results from the procedure. Thus, the first sentence, it is said, despite its reference to the fetus, has no application until a live birth results.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellants, of course, agree with the District Court. They take the position that \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) imposes its standard of care upon the person performing the abortion even though the procedure takes place before viability. They argue that the statute on its face effectively precludes abortion and was meant to do just that.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*83</span> We see nothing that requires federal-court abstention on this issue. <i>Wisconsin</i> v. <i>Constantineau,</i> 400 U. S. 433, 437-439 (1971); <i>Kusper</i> v. <i>Pontikes,</i> 414 U. S. 51, 54-55 (1973). And, like the three judges of the District Court, we are unable to accept the appellee's sophisticated interpretation of the statute. Section 6 (1) requires the physician to exercise the prescribed skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the <i>fetus.</i> It does not specify that such care need be taken only after the stage of viability has been reached. As the provision now reads, it impermissibly requires the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy. The fact that the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) refers to a criminal penalty where the physician fails \\\\\\\"to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the <i>child,</i> and the death of the <i>child</i> results\\\\\\\" (emphasis supplied), simply does not modify the duty imposed by the previous sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability.</p>\\\\n<p>The appellees finally argue that if the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) does not survive constitutional attack, the second sentence does, and, under the Act's severability provision, \\u00c2\\u00a7 B, is severable from the first. The District Court's ruling of unconstitutionality, 392 F. Supp., at 1371, made specific reference to the first sentence, but its conclusion of law and its judgment invalidated all of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1). <i>Id.,</i> at 1374; Jurisdictional Statement A-34 in No. 74-1419. Appellee Danforth's motion to alter or amend the judgment, so far as the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) was concerned, was denied by the District Court. <i>Id.,</i> at A-39.</p>\\\\n<p>We conclude, as did the District Court, that \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) must stand or fall as a unit. Its provisions are inextricably bound together. And a physician's or other person's criminal failure to protect a liveborn infant surely <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*84</span> will be subject to prosecution in Missouri under the State's criminal statutes.</p>\\\\n<p>The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\\\\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>H. C. S. HOUSE BILL NO. 1211</h2>\\\\n<p>AN ACT relating to abortion with penalty provisions and emergency clause.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows:</i></p>\\\\n<p>Section 1. It is the intention of the general assembly of the state of Missouri to reasonably regulate abortion in conformance with the decisions of the supreme court of the United States.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 2. Unless the language or context clearly indicates a different meaning is intended, the following words or phrases for the purpose of this act shall be given the meaning ascribed to them:</p>\\\\n<p>(1) \\\\\\\"Abortion,\\\\\\\" the intentional destruction of the life of an embryo or fetus in his or her mother's womb or the intentional termination of the pregnancy of a mother with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth or to remove a dead or dying unborn child;</p>\\\\n<p>(2) \\\\\\\"Viability,\\\\\\\" that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life-supportive systems;</p>\\\\n<p>(3) \\\\\\\"Physician,\\\\\\\" any person licensed to practice medicine <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*85</span> in this state by the state board of registration of the healing arts.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 3. No abortion shall be performed prior to the end of the first twelve weeks of pregnancy except:</p>\\\\n<p>(1) By a duly licensed, consenting physician in the exercise of his best clinical medical judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>(2) After the woman, prior to submitting to the abortion, certifies in writing her consent to the abortion and that her consent is informed and freely given and is not the result of coercion.</p>\\\\n<p>(3) With the written consent of the woman's spouse, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.</p>\\\\n<p>(4) With the written consent of one parent or person in loco parentis of the woman if the woman is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 4. No abortion performed subsequent to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy shall be performed except where the provisions of section 3 of this act are satisfied and in a hospital.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 5. No abortion not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother shall be performed unless the attending physician first certifies with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 6. (1) No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*86</span> shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter and upon conviction shall be punished as provided in Section 559.140, RSMo. Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages as provided in Section 537.080, RSMo.</p>\\\\n<p>(2) Whoever, with intent to do so, shall take the life of a premature infant aborted alive, shall be guilty of murder of the second degree.</p>\\\\n<p>(3) No person shall use any fetus or premature infant aborted alive for any type of scientific, research, laboratory or other kind of experimentation either prior to or subsequent to any abortion procedure except as necessary to protect or preserve the life and health of such premature infant aborted alive.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 7. In every case where a live born infant results from an attempted abortion which was not performed to save the life or health of the mother, such infant shall be an abandoned ward of the state under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court wherein the abortion occurred, and the mother and father, if he consented to the abortion, of such infant, shall have no parental rights or obligations whatsoever relating to such infant, as if the parental rights had been terminated pursuant to section 211.411, RSMo. The attending physician shall forthwith notify said juvenile court of the existence of such live born infant.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 8. Any woman seeking an abortion in the state of Missouri shall be verbally informed of the provisions of section 7 of this act by the attending physician and the woman shall certify in writing that she has been so informed.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 9. The general assembly finds that the method or technique of abortion known as saline amniocentesis <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*87</span> whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and a saline or other fluid is inserted into the amniotic sac for the purpose of killing the fetus and artificially inducing labor is deleterious to maternal health and is hereby prohibited after the first twelve weeks of pregnancy.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 10. 1. Every health facility and physician shall be supplied with forms promulgated by the division of health, the purpose and function of which shall be the preservation of maternal health and life by adding to the sum of medical knowledge through the compilation of relevant maternal health and life data and to monitor all abortions performed to assure that they are done only under and in accordance with the provisions of the law.</p>\\\\n<p>2. The forms shall be provided by the state division of health.</p>\\\\n<p>3. All information obtained by physician, hospital, clinic or other health facility from a patient for the purpose of preparing reports to the division of health under this section or reports received by the division of health shall be confidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes. Such records, however, may be inspected and health data acquired by local, state, or national public health officers.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 11. All medical records and other documents required to be kept shall be maintained in the permanent files of the health facility in which the abortion was performed for a period of seven years.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 12. Any practitioner of medicine, surgery, or nursing, or other health personnel who shall willfully and knowingly do or assist any action made unlawful by this act shall be subject to having his license, application for license, or authority to practice his profession as a physician, surgeon, or nurse in the state of Missouri <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*88</span> rejected or revoked by the appropriate state licensing board.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 13. Any physician or other person who fails to maintain the confidentiality of any records or reports required under this act is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by law.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 14. Any person who contrary to the provisions of this act knowingly performs or aids in the performance of any abortion or knowingly fails to perform any action required by this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by law.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 15. Any person who is not a licensed physician as defined in section 2 of this act who performs or attempts to perform an abortion on another as defined in subdivision (1) of section 2 of this act, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction, shall be imprisoned by the department of corrections for a term of not less than two years nor more than seventeen years.</p>\\\\n<p>Section 16. Nothing in this act shall be construed to exempt any person, firm, or corporation from civil liability for medical malpractice for negligent acts or certification under this act.</p>\\\\n<p>Section A. Because of the necessity for immediate state action to regulate abortions to protect the lives and health of citizens of this state, this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, peace and safety, and is hereby declared to be an emergency act within the meaning of the constitution, and this act shall be in full force and effect upon its passage and approval.</p>\\\\n<p>Section B. If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*89</span> held invalid, such invalidity does not affect the provisions or application of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications, and to this end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.</p>\\\\n<p>Approved June 14, 1974.</p>\\\\n<p>Effective June 14, 1974.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>While joining the Court's opinion, I write separately to indicate my understanding of some of the constitutional issues raised by this litigation.</p>\\\\n<p>With respect to the definition of viability in \\u00c2\\u00a7 2 (2) of the Act, it seems to me that the critical consideration is that the statutory definition has almost no operative significance. The State has merely required physicians performing abortions to <i>certify</i> that the fetus to be aborted is not viable. While the physician may be punished for failing to issue a certification, he may not be punished for erroneously concluding that the fetus is not viable. There is thus little chance that a physician's professional decision to perform an abortion will be \\\\\\\"chilled.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>I agree with the Court that the patient-consent provision in \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2) is constitutional. While \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (2) obviously regulates the abortion decision during all stages of pregnancy, including the first trimester, I do not believe it conflicts with the statement in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 163, that \\\\\\\"for the period of pregnancy prior to [approximately the end of the first trimester] the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*90</span> may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.\\\\\\\" That statement was made in the context of invalidating a state law aimed at thwarting a woman's decision to have an abortion. It was not intended to preclude the State from enacting a provision aimed at ensuring that the abortion decision is made in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary fashion.</p>\\\\n<p>As to the provision of the law that requires a husband's consent to an abortion, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3), the primary issue that it raises is whether the State may constitutionally recognize and give effect to a right on his part to participate in the decision to abort a jointly conceived child. This seems to me a rather more difficult problem than the Court acknowledges. Previous decisions have recognized that a man's right to father children and enjoy the association of his offspring is a constitutionally protected freedom. See <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645; <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535. But the Court has recognized as well that the Constitution protects \\\\\\\"a <i>woman's</i> decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 153 (emphasis added). In assessing the constitutional validity of \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) we are called upon to choose between these competing rights. I agree with the Court that since \\\\\\\"it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy. . . the balance weighs in her favor.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 71.</p>\\\\n<p>With respect to the state law's requirement of parental consent, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4), I think it clear that its primary constitutional deficiency lies in its imposition of an absolute limitation on the minor's right to obtain an abortion. The Court's opinion today in <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird, post,</i> at 147-148, suggests that a materially different constitutional issue would be presented under a provision requiring parental consent or consultation in most cases <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*91</span> but providing for prompt (i) judicial resolution of any disagreement between the parent and the minor, or (ii) judicial determination that the minor is mature enough to give an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion in any event is in the minor's best interest. Such a provision would not impose parental approval as an absolute condition upon the minor's right but would assure in most instances consultation between the parent and child.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>There can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child. That is a grave decision, and a girl of tender years, under emotional stress, may be ill-equipped to make it without mature advice and emotional support. It seems unlikely that she will obtain adequate counsel and support from the attending physician at an abortion clinic, where abortions for pregnant minors frequently take place.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*92</span> As to the constitutional validity of \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 of the Act, prohibiting the use of the saline amniocentesis procedure, I agree fully with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), this Court recognized a right to an abortion free from state prohibition. The task of policing this limitation on state police power is and will be a difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process. However, even accepting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> there is nothing in the opinion in that case and nothing articulated in the Court's opinion in this case which justifies the invalidation of four provisions of House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereafter Act) enacted by the Missouri 77th General Assembly in 1974 in response to <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> Accordingly, I dissent, in part.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p><i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 163, holds that until a fetus becomes viable, the interest of the State in the life or potential life it represents is outweighed by the interest of the mother in choosing \\\\\\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 153. Section 3 (3) of the Act provides that a married woman may not obtain an abortion without her husband's consent. The Court strikes down this statute in one sentence. It says that \\\\\\\"since the State cannot . . . proscribe abortion . . . the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*93</span> even the spouse, to prevent abortion . . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 69. But the State is not\\u00c2\\u2014under \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3)\\u00c2\\u2014delegating to the husband the power to vindicate the <i>State's</i> interest in the future life of the fetus. It is instead recognizing that the husband has an interest of his own in the life of the fetus which should not be extinguished by the unilateral decision of the wife.<sup>[1]</sup> It by no means follows, from the fact that the mother's interest in deciding \\\\\\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy\\\\\\\" outweighs the <i>State's</i> interest in the potential life of the fetus, that the husband's interest is also outweighed and may not be protected by the State. A father's interest in having a child\\u00c2\\u2014perhaps his only child\\u00c2\\u2014may be unmatched by any other interest in his life. See <i>Stanley</i> v. <i>Illinois,</i> 405 U. S. 645, 651 (1972), and cases there cited. It is truly surprising that the majority finds in the United States Constitution, as it must in order to justify the result it reaches, a rule that the State must assign a greater value to a mother's decision to cut off a potential human life by abortion than to a father's decision to let it mature into a live child. Such a rule cannot be found there, nor can it be found in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i><i>.</i> These are matters which a State should be able to decide free from the suffocating power of the federal judge, purporting to act in the name of the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*94</span> In describing the nature of a mother's interest in termininating a pregnancy, the Court in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> mentioned only the post-birth burdens of rearing a child, 410 U. S., at 153, and rejected a rule based on her interest in controlling her own body during pregnancy. <i>Id.,</i> at 154. Missouri has a law which prevents a woman from putting a child up for adoption over her husband's objection, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 453.030 (1969). This law represents a judgment by the State that the mother's interest in avoiding the burdens of child rearing do not outweigh or snuff out the father's interest in participating in bringing up his own child. That law is plainly valid, but no more so than \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) of the Act now before us, resting as it does on precisely the same judgment.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 3 (4) requires that an unmarried woman under 18 years of age obtain the consent of a parent or a person <i>in loco parentis</i> as a condition to an abortion. Once again the Court strikes the provision down in a sentence. It states: \\\\\\\"Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy. . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 74. The Court rejects the notions that the <i>State</i> has an interest in strengthening the family unit, or that the <i>parent</i> has an \\\\\\\"independent interest\\\\\\\" in the abortion decision, sufficient to justify \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (4) and apparently concludes that the provision is therefore unconstitutional. But the purpose of the parental-consent requirement is not merely to vindicate any interest of the parent or of the State. The purpose of the requirement is to vindicate the very right created in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i>\\u00c2\\u2014the right of the pregnant woman to decide <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*95</span> \\\\\\\"whether <i>or not</i> to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 410 U. S., at 153 (emphasis added). The abortion decision is unquestionably important and has irrevocable consequences whichever way it is made. Missouri is entitled to protect the minor unmarried woman from making the decision in a way which is not in her own best interests, and it seeks to achieve this goal by requiring parental consultation and consent. This is the traditional way by which States have sought to protect children from their own immature and improvident decisions;<sup>[2]</sup> and there is absolutely no reason expressed by the majority why the State may not utilize that method here.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 9 of the Act prohibits abortion by the method known as saline amniocentesis\\u00c2\\u2014a method used at the time the Act was passed for 70% of abortions performed after the first trimester. Legislative history reveals that the Missouri Legislature viewed saline amniocentesis as far less safe a method of abortion than the so-called prostaglandin method. The court below took evidence on the question and summarized it as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The record of trial discloses that use of the saline method exposes a woman to the danger of severe complications, regardless of the skill of the physician or the precaution taken. Saline may cause one or <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*96</span> more of the following conditions: Disseminated intravascular coagulation or `consumptive coagulapathy' (disruption of the blood clotting mechanism [Dr. Warren, Tr. 57-58; Dr. Klaus, Tr. 269-270; Dr. Anderson, Tr. 307; Defts' Exs. H &amp; M]), which may result in severe bleeding and possibly death (Dr. Warren, Tr. 58); hypernatremia (increase in blood sodium level), which may lead to convulsions and death (Dr. Klaus, Tr. 268); and water intoxication (accumulated water in the body tissue which may occur when oxytoxin is used in conjunction with the injection of saline), resulting in damage to the central nervous system or death (Dr. Warren, Tr. 76; Dr. Klaus, Tr. 270-271; Dr. Anderson, Tr. 310; Defts' Ex. L). There is also evidence that saline amniocentesis causes massive tissue destruction to the inside of the uterus (Dr. Anderson, Tr. 308).\\\\\\\" 392 F. Supp. 1362, 1372-1373 (1975).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court also cited considerable evidence establishing that the prostaglandin method is safer. In fact, the Chief of Obstetrics at Yale University, Dr. Anderson, suggested that \\\\\\\"physicians should be liable for malpractice if they chose saline over prostaglandin after having been given all the facts on both methods.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1373. The Court nevertheless reverses the decision of the District Court sustaining \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 against constitutional challenge. It does so apparently because saline amniocentesis was widely used before the Act was passed; because the prostaglandin method was seldom used and was not generally available; and because other abortion techniques more dangerous than saline amniocentesis were not banned. At bottom the majority's holding\\u00c2\\u2014as well as the concurrence\\u00c2\\u2014rests on its <i>factual</i> finding that the prostaglandin method is unavailable to the women of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*97</span> Missouri. It therefore concludes that the ban on the saline method is \\\\\\\"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 79. This factual finding was not made either by the majority or by the dissenting judge below. Appellants have not argued that the record below supports such a finding. In fact the record below does not support such a finding. There is <i>no</i> evidence in the record that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions by the prostaglandin method. What evidence there is in the record on this question supports the contrary conclusion.<sup>[3]</sup> The record discloses that the prostaglandin method of abortion was the country's second most common method of abortion during the second trimester, Tr. 42, 89-90; that although the prostaglandin method had previously been available only on an experimental basis, it was, at the time of trial available in \\\\\\\"small hospitals all over the country,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 342; that in another year or so the prostaglandin method would become \\u00c2\\u2014even in the absence of legislation on the subject\\u00c2\\u2014 the most prevalent method.

Moreover, one doctor quite sensibly testified that if the saline method were banned, hospitals would quickly switch to the prostaglandin method.</p>\\\\n<p>The majority relies on the testimony of one doctor that\\u00c2\\u2014as already noted\\u00c2\\u2014prostaglandin had been available on an experimental basis only until January 1, 1974; and that its manufacturer, the Upjohn Co., restricted its sales to large medical centers for the following six months, after which sales were to be unrestricted. Tr. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*98</span> 334-335. In what manner this evidence supports the proposition that prostaglandin is unavailable to the women of Missouri escapes me. The statute involved in this litigation was passed on June 14, 1974; evidence was taken in July 1974; the District Court's decree sustaining the ban on the saline method which this Court overturns was entered in January 1975; and this Court declares the statute unconstitutional in July 1976. There is simply no evidence in the record that prostaglandin was or is unavailable at any time relevant to this case. Without such evidence and without any factual finding by the court below this Court cannot properly strike down a statute passed by one of the States. Of course, there is no burden on a State to establish the constitutionality of one of its laws. Absent proof of a fact essential to its unconstitutionality, the statute remains in effect.</p>\\\\n<p>The only other basis for its factual finding which the majority offers is a citation to <i>another</i> case\\u00c2\\u2014<i>Wolfe</i> v. <i>Schroering,</i> 388 F. Supp. 631, 637 (WD Ky. 1974)\\u00c2\\u2014in which a different court concluded that the record in its case showed the prostaglandin method to be unavailable in another State\\u00c2\\u2014Kentucky\\u00c2\\u2014at another time\\u00c2\\u2014two years ago. This case must be decided on its own record. I am not yet prepared to accept the notion that normal rules of law, procedure, and constitutional adjudication suddenly become irrelevant solely because a case touches on the subject of abortion. The majority's finding of fact that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions after the first trimester if the saline method is banned is wholly unjustifiable.</p>\\\\n<p>In any event, the point of \\u00c2\\u00a7 9 is to change the practice under which most abortions were performed under the saline amniocentesis method and to make the safer prostaglandin method generally available. It promises to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*99</span> achieve that result, if it remains operative, and the evidence discloses that the result is a desirable one or at least that the legislature could have so viewed it. That should end our inquiry, unless we purport to be not only the country's continuous constitutional convention but also its <i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 6 (1) of the Act provides:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. . . . Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages.\\\\\\\"</blockquote>\\\\n<p>If this section is read in any way other than through a microscope, it is plainly intended to require that, where a \\\\\\\"fetus [may have] the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 163, the abortion be handled in a way which is designed to preserve that life notwithstanding the mother's desire to terminate it. Indeed, even looked at through a microscope the statute seems to go no further. It requires a physician to exercise \\\\\\\"<i>that</i> degree of professional skill . . . to preserve the . . . fetus,\\\\\\\" which he would be required to exercise if the mother wanted a live child. Plainly, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*100</span> if the pregnancy is to be terminated at a time when there is no chance of life outside the womb, a physician would not be required to exercise any care or skill to preserve the life of the fetus during abortion no matter what the mother's desires. The statute would appear then to operate only in the gray area after the fetus <i>might</i> be viable but while the physician is still able to certify \\\\\\\"with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable.\\\\\\\" See \\u00c2\\u00a7 5 of the Act which flatly prohibits abortions absent such a certification. Since the State has a compelling interest, sufficient to outweigh the mother's desire to kill the fetus, when the \\\\\\\"fetus . . . has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 163, the statute is constitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>Incredibly, the Court reads the statute instead to require \\\\\\\"the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 83, thereby attributing to the Missouri Legislature the strange intention of passing a statute with absolutely no chance of surviving constitutional challenge under <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The Court compounds its error by also striking down as unseverable the wholly unobjectionable requirement in the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) that where an abortion produces a live child, steps must be taken to sustain its life. It explains its result in two sentences:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"We conclude, as did the District Court, that \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) must stand or fall as a unit. Its provisions are inextricably bound together.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 83.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The question whether a constitutional provision of state law is severable from an unconstitutional provision is <i>entirely</i> a question of the intent of the state legislature. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the Missouri Legislature would not require proper care <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*101</span> for live babies just because it cannot require physicians performing abortions to take care to preserve the life of fetuses. The Attorney General of Missouri has argued here that the <i>only</i> intent of \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) was to require physicians to support a live baby which resulted from an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>At worst, \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) is ambiguous on both points and the District Court should be directed to abstain until a construction may be had from the state courts. Under no circumstances should \\u00c2\\u00a7 6 (1) be declared unconstitutional at this point.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>V</h2>\\\\n<p>I join the judgment and opinion of the Court insofar as it upholds the other portions of the Act against constitutional challenge.</p>\\\\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>With the exception of Parts IV-D and IV-E, I join the Court's opinion.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, the Court held that a woman's right to decide whether to abort a pregnancy is entitled to constitutional protection. That decision, which is now part of our law, answers the question discussed in Part IV-E of the Court's opinion, but merely poses the question decided in Part IV-D.</p>\\\\n<p>If two abortion procedures had been equally accessible to Missouri women, in my judgment the United States Constitution would not prevent the state legislature <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*102</span> from outlawing the one it found to be less safe even though its conclusion might not reflect a unanimous consensus of informed medical opinion. However, the record indicates that when the Missouri statute was enacted, a prohibition of the saline amniocentesis procedure was almost tantamount to a prohibition of any abortion in the State after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Such a prohibition is inconsistent with the essential holding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> and therefore cannot stand.</p>\\\\n<p>In my opinion, however, the parental-consent requirement is consistent with the holding in <i>Roe.</i> The State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a variety of protective measures. Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain. He may not lawfully work or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures. Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent. Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant. The State's interest in protecting a young person from harm justifies the imposition of restraints on his or her freedom even though comparable restraints on adults would be constitutionally impermissible. Therefore, the holding in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> that the abortion decision is entitled to constitutional protection merely emphasizes the importance of the decision; it does not lead to the conclusion that the state legislature has no power to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an incorrect decision.</p>\\\\n<p>The abortion decision is, of course, more important than the decision to attend or to avoid an adult motion picture, or the decision to work long hours in a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*103</span> factory. It is not necessarily any more important than the decision to run away from home or the decision to marry. But even if it is the most important kind of a decision a young person may ever make, that assumption merely enhances the quality of the State's interest in maximizing the probability that the decision be made correctly and with full understanding of the consequences of either alternative.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court recognizes that the State may insist that the decision not be made without the benefit of medical advice. But since the most significant consequences of the decision are not medical in character, it would seem to me that the State may, with equal legitimacy, insist that the decision be made only after other appropriate counsel has been had as well. Whatever choice a pregnant young woman makes\\u00c2\\u2014to marry, to abort, to bear her child out of wedlock\\u00c2\\u2014the consequences of her decision may have a profound impact on her entire future life. A legislative determination that such a choice will be made more wisely in most cases if the advice and moral support of a parent play a part in the decisionmaking process is surely not irrational. Moreover, it is perfectly clear that the parental-consent requirement will necessarily involve a parent in the decisional process.</p>\\\\n<p>If there is no parental-consent requirement, many minors will submit to the abortion procedure without ever informing their parents. An assumption that the parental reaction will be hostile, disparaging, or violent no doubt persuades many children simply to bypass parental counsel which would in fact be loving, supportive, and, indeed, for some indispensable. It is unrealistic, in my judgment, to assume that every parent-child relationship is either (a) so perfect that communication and accord will take place routinely or <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*104</span> (b) so imperfect that the absence of communication reflects the child's correct prediction that the parent will exercise his or her veto arbitrarily to further a selfish interest rather than the child's interest. A state legislature may conclude that most parents will be primarily interested in the welfare of their children, and further, that the imposition of a parental-consent requirement is an appropriate method of giving the parents an opportunity to foster that welfare by helping a pregnant distressed child to make and to implement a correct decision.</p>\\\\n<p>The State's interest is not dependent on an estimate of the impact the parental-consent requirement may have on the total number of abortions that may take place. I assume that parents will sometimes prevent abortions which might better be performed; other parents may advise abortions that should not be performed. Similarly, even doctors are not omniscient; specialists in performing abortions may incorrectly conclude that the immediate advantages of the procedure outweigh the disadvantages which a parent could evaluate in better perspective. In each individual case factors much more profound than a mere medical judgment may weigh heavily in the scales. The overriding consideration is that the right to make the choice be exercised as wisely as possible.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court assumes that parental consent is an appropriate requirement if the minor is not capable of understanding the procedure and of appreciating its consequences and those of available alternatives. This assumption is, of course, correct and consistent with the predicate which underlies all state legislation seeking to protect minors from the consequences of decisions they are not yet prepared to make. In all such situations chronological age has been the basis for imposition of a restraint on the minor's freedom of choice even though <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*105</span> it is perfectly obvious that such a yardstick is imprecise and perhaps even unjust in particular cases. The Court seems to assume that the capacity to conceive a child and the judgment of the physician are the only constitutionally permissible yardsticks for determining whether a young woman can independently make the abortion decision. I doubt the accuracy of the Court's empirical judgment. Even if it were correct, however, as a matter of constitutional law I think a State has power to conclude otherwise and to select a chronological age as its standard.</p>\\\\n<p>In short, the State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens is sufficient, in my judgment, to support the parental-consent requirement.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]  Together with No. 74-1419, <i>Danforth, Attorney General of Missouri</i> v. <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri et al.,</i> also on appeal from the same court.</p>\\\\n<p>[\\u00c2\\u2020]  <i>Rhonda Copelon</i> and <i>Nancy Stearns</i> filed a brief in both cases for the Center for Constitutional Rights et al. as <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal in No. 74-1151.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> were filed in both cases by <i>Eugene Krasicky, George E.

Accordingly, the physician-appellants do not have standing to challenge \\u00c2\\u00a7 7 of the Act.</p>\\\\n<p>The District Court did not decide whether Planned Parenthood has standing to challenge the Act, or any portion of it, because of its view that the physician-appellants have standing to challenge the entire Act. 392 F.

That question appropriately may be left to the District Court for reconsideration on remand. As a consequence, we do not decide the issue of \\u00c2\\u00a7 7's constitutionality.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  \\\\\\\"[A]lthough I agree with the definition of `viability,' I think that it must be understood that viability is a very difficult state to assess.\\\\\\\" Tr. 369.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  \\\\\\\"The determination of when the fetus is viable rests, as it should, with the physician, in the exercise of his medical judgment, on a case-by-case basis.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellee Danforth 26. \\\\\\\"Because viability may vary from patient to patient and with advancements in medical technology, it is essential that physicians make the determination in the exercise of their medical judgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 28. \\\\\\\"Defendant agrees that `viability' will vary, that it is a difficult state to assess . . . and that it must be left to the physician's judgment.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 29.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  The Minnesota statute under attack in <i>Hodgson</i> provided that a fetus \\\\\\\"shall be considered potentially `viable' \\\\\\\" during the second half of its gestation period. Noting that the defendants had presented no evidence of viability at 20 weeks, the three-judge District Court held that that definition of viability was \\\\\\\"unreasonable and cannot stand.\\\\\\\" 378 F. Supp., at 1016.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  Apparently, however, the only other Missouri statutes concerned with consent for general medical or surgical care relate to persons committed to the Missouri State chest hospital, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 199.240 (Supp. 1975), or to mental or correctional institutions, \\u00c2\\u00a7 105.700 (1969).</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  There is some testimony in the record to the effect that taking from the patient a prior written consent to surgery is the custom. That may be so in some areas of Missouri, but we definitely refrain from characterizing it extremely as \\\\\\\"the universal practice of the medical profession,\\\\\\\" as the appellees do. Brief for Appellee Danforth 32.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  The appellants' vagueness argument centers on the word \\\\\\\"informed.\\\\\\\" One might well wonder, offhand, just what \\\\\\\"informed consent\\\\\\\" of a patient is. The three Missouri federal judges who composed the three-judge District Court, however, were not concerned, and we are content to accept, as the meaning, the giving of information to the patient as to just what would be done and as to its consequences. To ascribe more meaning than this might well confine the attending physician in an undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket in the practice of his profession.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  It is of some interest to note that the condition does not relate, as most statutory conditions in this area do, to the preservation of the life or <i>health</i> of the mother.</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  \\\\\\\"We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights\\u00c2\\u2014 older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.\\\\\\\" <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S., at 486.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  As the Court recognized in <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird</i><i>,</i> \\\\\\\"the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the <i>individual,</i> married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\\\\\\" 405 U. S., at 453 (emphasis in original).\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>The dissenting opinion of our Brother WHITE appears to overlook the implications of this statement upon the issue whether \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) is constitutional. This section does much more than insure that the husband participate in the decision whether his wife should have an abortion. The State, instead, has determined that the husband's interest in continuing the pregnancy of his wife always outweighs any interest on her part in terminating it irrespective of the condition of their marriage. The State, accordingly, has granted him the right to prevent unilaterally, and for whatever reason, the effectuation of his wife's and her physician's decision to terminate her pregnancy. This state determination not only may discourage the consultation that might normally be expected to precede a major decision affecting the martial couple but also, and more importantly, the State has interposed an absolute obstacle to a woman's decision that <i>Roe</i> held to be constitutionally protected from such interference.</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  In response to MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S criticism that the prostaglandin method of inducing abortion was available in Missouri, either at the time the Act was passed or at the time of trial, we make the following observations. First, there is no evidence in the record to which our Brother has pointed that demonstrates that the prostaglandin method was or is available in Missouri. Second, the evidence presented to the District Court does not support such a view. Until January 1974 prostaglandin was used only on an experimental basis in a few medical centers. And, at the time the Missouri General Assembly proscribed saline, the sole distributor of prostaglandin \\\\\\\"restricted sales to around twenty medical centers from coast to coast.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellee Danforth 68.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>It is clear, therefore, that at the time the Missouri General Assembly passed the Act, prostaglandin was not available, in any meaningful sense of that term. Because of this undisputed fact, it was incumbent upon appellees to show that at the time of trial in 1974 prostaglandin was available. They failed to do so. Indeed, appellees' expert witness, on whose testimony the dissenting opinion relies, does not fill this void. He was able to state only that prostaglandin was used in a limited way until shortly before trial and that he \\\\\\\"would think\\\\\\\" that it was more readily available at the time of trial. Tr. 335. Such an experimental and limited use of prostaglandin throughout the country does not make it available or accessible to concerned persons in Missouri.</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  We note that in Missouri physicians must participate in the reporting of births and deaths, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 193.100 and 193.140 (1969), and communicable diseases, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 192.020 and 192.040 (1969), and that their use of controlled substances is rigidly monitored by the State, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 195.010-195.545 (1969 and Supp. 1975).</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  For some of the considerations that support the State's interest in encouraging parental consent, see the opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part. <i>Post,</i> at 102-105.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  The mode of operation of one such clinic is revealed by the record in <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird, post,</i> p. 132, and accurately described by appellants in that case:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The counseling . . . occurs entirely on the day the abortion is to be performed . . . . It lasts for two hours and takes place in groups that include both minors and adults who are strangers to one another . . . . The physician takes no part in this counseling process . . . . Counseling is typically limited to a description of abortion procedures, possible complications, and birth control techniques . . . .</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The abortion itself takes five to seven minutes . . . . The physician has no prior contact with the minor, and on the days that abortions are being performed at the [clinic], the physician, . . . may be performing abortions on many other adults and minors . . . .

After the abortion [the physician] spends a brief period with the minor and others in the group in the recovery room . . . .\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellants in No. 75-73, O. T. 1975, pp. 43-44.</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  There are countless situations in which the State prohibits conduct only when it is objected to by a private person most closely affected by it. Thus a State cannot forbid anyone to enter on private property with the owner's consent, but it may enact and enforce trespass laws against unauthorized entrances. It cannot forbid transfer of property held in tenancy by the entireties but it may require consent by both husband and wife to such a transfer. These situations plainly do not involve delegations of legislative power to private parties; and neither does the requirement in \\u00c2\\u00a7 3 (3) that a woman not deprive her husband of his future child without his consent.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  As MR. JUSTICE STEVENS states in his separate opinion, <i>post,</i> at 102:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"The State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a variety of protective measures. Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain.

Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent. Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The absence of more evidence on the subject in the record seems to be a result of the fact that the claim that the prostaglandin method is unavailable was not part of plaintiffs' litigating strategy below.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  The majority's construction of state law is, of course, not binding on the Missouri courts. If they should disagree with the majority's reading of state law on one or both of the points treated by the majority, the State could validly enforce the relevant parts of the statute\\u00c2\\u2014at least against all those people not parties to this case.

We understand the controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering. Taking account of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*921</span> these virtually irreconcilable points of view, aware that constitutional law must govern a society whose different members sincerely hold directly opposing views, and considering the matter in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental individual liberty, this Court, in the course of a generation, has determined and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection to the woman's right to choose. <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973); <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992). We shall not revisit those legal principles. Rather, we apply them to the circumstances of this case.</p>\\\\n<p>Three established principles determine the issue before us. We shall set them forth in the language of the joint opinion in <i>Casey.</i> First, before \\\\\\\"viability . . . the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 870 (plurality opinion).</p>\\\\n<p>Second, \\\\\\\"a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability\\\\\\\" is unconstitutional. <i>Id.,</i> at 877. An \\\\\\\"undue burden is . . . shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>Third, \\\\\\\"`subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 879 (quoting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 164-165).</p>\\\\n<p>We apply these principles to a Nebraska law banning \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion.\\\\\\\" The statute reads as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"No partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state, unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*922</span> from the pregnancy itself.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The statute defines \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" as:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"an abortion procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>It further defines \\\\\\\"partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child\\\\\\\" to mean</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </blockquote>\\\\n<p>The law classifies violation of the statute as a \\\\\\\"Class III felony\\\\\\\" carrying a prison term of up to 20 years, and a fine of up to $25,000. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(2), 28-105. It also provides for the automatic revocation of a doctor's license to practice medicine in Nebraska. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(4).</p>\\\\n<p>We hold that this statute violates the Constitution.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Dr. Leroy Carhart is a Nebraska physician who performs abortions in a clinical setting. He brought this lawsuit in Federal District Court seeking a declaration that the Nebraska statute violates the Federal Constitution, and asking for an injunction forbidding its enforcement. After a trial on the merits, during which both sides presented several expert witnesses, the District Court held the statute unconstitutional. 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099 (Neb. 1998). On appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 192 F. 3d 1142 (1999); cf. <i>Hope Clinic</i> v. <i>Ryan,</i> 195 F. 3d 857 (CA7 1999) (en banc) (considering <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*923</span> a similar statute, but reaching a different legal conclusion). We granted certiorari to consider the matter.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Because Nebraska law seeks to ban one method of aborting a pregnancy, we must describe and then discuss several different abortion procedures. Considering the fact that those procedures seek to terminate a potential human life, our discussion may seem clinically cold or callous to some, perhaps horrifying to others. There is no alternative way, however, to acquaint the reader with the technical distinctions among different abortion methods and related factual matters, upon which the outcome of this case depends. For that reason, drawing upon the findings of the trial court, underlying testimony, and related medical texts, we shall describe the relevant methods of performing abortions in technical detail.</p>\\\\n<p>The evidence before the trial court, as supported or supplemented in the literature, indicates the following:</p>\\\\n<p>1. About 90% of all abortions performed in the United States take place during the first trimester of pregnancy, before 12 weeks of gestational age. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance\\u00c2\\u2014United States, 1996, p. 41 (July 30, 1999) (hereinafter Abortion Surveillance). During the first trimester, the predominant abortion method is \\\\\\\"vacuum aspiration,\\\\\\\" which involves insertion of a vacuum tube (cannula) into the uterus to evacuate the contents. Such an abortion is typically performed on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1102; Obstetrics: Normal &amp; Problem Pregnancies 1253-1254 (S. Gabbe, J. Niebyl, &amp; J. Simpson eds. 3d ed. 1996). Vacuum aspiration is considered particularly safe. The procedure's mortality rates for first trimester abortion are, for example, 5 to 10 times lower than those associated with carrying the fetus to term. Complication rates are also low. <i>Id.,</i> at 1251; Lawson et al., Abortion Mortality, United <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*924</span> States, 1972 through 1987, 171 Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1365, 1368 (1994); M. Paul et al., A Clinicians Guide to Medical and Surgical Abortion 108-109 (1999) (hereinafter Medical and Surgical Abortion). As the fetus grows in size, however, the vacuum aspiration method becomes increasingly difficult to use. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1102-1103; Obstetrics: Normal &amp; Problem Pregnancies, <i>supra,</i> at 1268.</p>\\\\n<p>2. Approximately 10% of all abortions are performed during the second trimester of pregnancy (12 to 24 weeks). Abortion Surveillance 41. In the early 1970's, inducing labor through the injection of saline into the uterus was the predominant method of second trimester abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 8; <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 76 (1976). Today, however, the medical profession has switched from medical induction of labor to surgical procedures for most second trimester abortions. The most commonly used procedure is called \\\\\\\"dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" (D&amp;E). That procedure (together with a modified form of vacuum aspiration used in the early second trimester) accounts for about 95% of all abortions performed from 12 to 20 weeks of gestational age. Abortion Surveillance 41.</p>\\\\n<p>3. D&amp;E \\\\\\\"refers generically to transcervical procedures performed at 13 weeks gestation or later.\\\\\\\" American Medical Association, Report of Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion, App. 490 (hereinafter AMA Report). The AMA Report, adopted by the District Court, describes the process as follows.</p>\\\\n<p>Between 13 and 15 weeks of gestation:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"D&amp;E is similar to vacuum aspiration except that the cervix must be dilated more widely because surgical instruments are used to remove larger pieces of tissue. Osmotic dilators are usually used. Intravenous fluids and an analgesic or sedative may be administered. A local anesthetic such as a paracervical block may be administered, dilating agents, if used, are removed and instruments are inserted through the cervix into the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*925</span> uterus to removal fetal and placental tissue. Because fetal tissue is friable and easily broken, the fetus may not be removed intact. The walls of the uterus are scraped with a curette to ensure that no tissue remains.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 490-491.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>After 15 weeks:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Because the fetus is larger at this stage of gestation (particularly the head), and because bones are more rigid, dismemberment or other destructive procedures are more likely to be required than at earlier gestational ages to remove fetal and placental tissue.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 491.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>After 20 weeks:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Some physicians use intrafetal potassium chloride or digoxin to induce fetal demise prior to a late D&amp;E (after 20 weeks), to facilitate evacuation.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 491-492.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>There are variations in D&amp;E operative strategy; compare <i>ibid.</i> with W. Hern, Abortion Practice 146-156 (1984), and Medical and Surgical Abortion 133-135. However, the common points are that D&amp;E involves (1) dilation of the cervix; (2) removal of at least some fetal tissue using nonvacuum instruments; and (3) (after the 15th week) the potential need for instrumental disarticulation or dismemberment of the fetus or the collapse of fetal parts to facilitate evacuation from the uterus.</p>\\\\n<p>4. When instrumental disarticulation incident to D&amp;E is necessary, it typically occurs as the doctor pulls a portion of the fetus through the cervix into the birth canal. Dr. Carhart testified at trial as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Dr. Carhart: . . . `The dismemberment occurs between the traction of . . . my instrument and the countertraction of the internal so of the cervix . . . . \\\\\\\"Counsel: `So the dismemberment occurs after you pulled a part of the fetus through the cervix, is that correct?</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*926</span> \\\\\\\"Dr. Carhart: `Exactly. Because you're using\\u00c2\\u2014The cervix has two strictures or two rings, the internal so and the external so . . . that's what's actually doing the dismembering. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Counsel: `When we talked before or talked before about a D&amp;E, that is not\\u00c2\\u2014where there is not intention to do it intact, do you, in that situation, dismember the fetus in utero first, then remove portions? \\\\\\\"Dr. Carhart: `I don't think so. . . . I don't know of any way that one could go in and intentionally dismember the fetus in the uterus. . . . It takes something that restricts the motion of the fetus against what you're doing before you're going to get dismemberment.' \\\\\\\" 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1104.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Dr. Carhart's specification of the location of fetal disarticulation is consistent with other sources. See Medical and Surgical Abortion 135; App. in Nos. 98-3245 and 98-3300 (CA8), p. 683, (testimony of Dr. Phillip Stubblefield) (\\\\\\\"Q: So you don't actually dismember the fetus in utero, then take the pieces out? A: No\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>5. The D&amp;E procedure carries certain risks. The use of instruments within the uterus creates a danger of accidental perforation and damage to neighboring organs. Sharp fetal bone fragments create similar dangers. And fetal tissue accidentally left behind can cause infection and various other complications. See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1110; Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery 1045 (D. Nichols &amp; D. ClarkePearson eds. 2d ed. 2000); F. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 598 (20th ed. 1997). Nonetheless studies show that the risks of mortality and complication that accompany the D&amp;E procedure between the 12th and 20th weeks of gestation are significantly lower than those accompanying induced labor procedures (the next safest midsecond trimester procedures). See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, <i>supra,</i> at 1046; AMA Report, App. 495, 496; Medical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*927</span> and Surgical Abortion 139, 142; Lawson, 171 Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol., at 1368.</p>\\\\n<p>6. At trial, Dr. Carhart and Dr. Stubblefield described a variation of the D&amp;E procedure, which they referred to as an \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E.\\\\\\\" See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105, 1111. Like other versions of the D&amp;E technique, it begins with induced dilation of the cervix. The procedure then involves removing the fetus from the uterus through the cervix \\\\\\\"intact,\\\\\\\" <i>i. e.,</i> in one pass, rather than in several passes. <i>Ibid.</i> It is used after 16 weeks at the earliest, as vacuum aspiration becomes ineffective and the fetal skull becomes too large to pass through the cervix. <i>Id.,</i> at 1105. The intact D&amp;E proceeds in one of two ways, depending on the presentation of the fetus. If the fetus presents head first (a vertex presentation), the doctor collapses the skull; and the doctor then extracts the entire fetus through the cervix. If the fetus presents feet first (a breech presentation), the doctor pulls the fetal body through the cervix, collapses the skull, and extracts the fetus through the cervix. <i>Ibid.</i> The breech extraction version of the intact D&amp;E is also known commonly as \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction,\\\\\\\" or D&amp;X. <i>Id.,</i> at 1112. In the late second trimester, vertex, breech, and traverse/ compound (sideways) presentations occur in roughly similar proportions. Medical and Surgical Abortion 135; 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108.</p>\\\\n<p>7. The intact D&amp;E procedure can also be found described in certain obstetric and abortion clinical textbooks, where two variations are recognized. The first, as just described, calls for the physician to adapt his method for extracting the intact fetus depending on fetal presentation. See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, <i>supra,</i> at 1043; Medical and Surgical Abortion 136-137. This is the method used by Dr. Carhart. See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105. A slightly different version of the intact D&amp;E procedure, associated with Dr. Martin Haskell, calls for conversion to a breech presentation in all cases. See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*928</span> Surgery, <i>supra,</i> at 1043 (citing M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), in 139 Cong. Rec. 8605 (1993)).</p>\\\\n<p>8. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists describes the D&amp;X procedure in a manner corresponding to a breech-conversion intact D&amp;E, including the following steps:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a sequence of days;</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling breech;</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus.\\\\\\\" American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997) (hereinafter ACOG Statement), App. 599-560.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Despite the technical differences we have just described, intact D&amp;E and D&amp;X are sufficiently similar for us to use the terms interchangeably.</p>\\\\n<p>9. Dr. Carhart testified he attempts to use the intact D&amp;E procedure during weeks 16 to 20 because (1) it reduces the dangers from sharp bone fragments passing through the cervix, (2) minimizes the number of instrument passes needed for extraction and lessens the likelihood of uterine perforations caused by those instruments, (3) reduces the likelihood of leaving infection-causing fetal and placental tissue in the uterus, and (4) could help to prevent potentially fatal absorption of fetal tissue into the maternal circulation. See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1107. The District Court made no findings about the D&amp;X procedure's overall safety. <i>Id.</i> , at 1126, n. 39. The District Court concluded, however, that \\\\\\\"the evidence is both clear and convincing that Carhart's <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*929</span> D&amp;X procedure is superior to, and safer than, the . . . other abortion procedures used during the relevant gestational period in the 10 to 20 cases a year that present to Dr. Carhart.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1126.</p>\\\\n<p>10. The materials presented at trial referred to the potential benefits of the D&amp;X procedure in circumstances involving nonviable fetuses, such as fetuses with abnormal fluid accumulation in the brain (hydrocephaly). See 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1107 (quoting AMA Report, App. 492 (\\\\\\\"`Intact D&amp;X may be preferred by some physicians, particularly when the fetus has been diagnosed with hydrocephaly or other anomalies incompatible with life outside the womb' \\\\\\\")); see also Grimes, The Continuing Need for Late Abortions, 280 JAMA 747, 748 (Aug. 26, 1998) (D&amp;X \\\\\\\"may be especially useful in the presence of fetal anomalies, such as hydrocephalus,\\\\\\\" because its reduction of the cranium allows \\\\\\\"a smaller diameter to pass through the cervix, thus reducing risk of cervical injury\\\\\\\"). Others have emphasized its potential for women with prior uterine scars, or for women for whom induction of labor would be particularly dangerous. See <i>Women's Medical Professional Corp.</i> v. <i>Voinovich,</i> 911 F. Supp. 2d 1051, 1067 (SD Ohio 1995); <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Kelley,</i> 977 F. Supp. 2d 1283, 1296 (ED Mich. 1997).</p>\\\\n<p>11. There are no reliable data on the number of D&amp;X abortions performed annually. Estimates have ranged between 640 and 5,000 per year. Compare Henshaw, Abortion Incidence and Services in the United States, 1995-1996, 30 Family Planning Perspectives 263, 268 (1998), with Joint Hearing on S. 6 and H. R. 929 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 46 (1997).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute, making criminal the performance of a \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" violates the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*930</span> <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973). We conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons. First, the law lacks any exception \\\\\\\"`for the preservation of the . . . health of the mother.' \\\\\\\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 879 (plurality opinion). Second, it \\\\\\\"imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability\\\\\\\" to choose a D&amp;E abortion, thereby unduly burdening the right to choose abortion itself. <i>Id.,</i> at 874. We shall discuss each of these reasons in turn.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The <i>Casey</i> plurality opinion reiterated what the Court held in <i>Roe;</i> that \\\\\\\"`subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion <i>except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</i> ` \\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 879 (quoting <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 164-165) (emphasis added).</p>\\\\n<p>The fact that Nebraska's law applies both previability and postviability aggravates the constitutional problem presented. The State's interest in regulating abortion previability is considerably weaker than postviability. See <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 870. Since the law requires a health exception in order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation. See <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 880 (majority opinion) (assuming need for health exception previability); see also <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 316 (1980).</p>\\\\n<p>The quoted standard also depends on the state regulations \\\\\\\"promoting [the State's] interest in the potentiality of human life.\\\\\\\" The Nebraska law, of course, does not directly further an interest \\\\\\\"in the potentiality of human life\\\\\\\" by saving the fetus in question from destruction, as it regulates only a <i>method</i> of performing abortion. Nebraska describes its interests differently. It says the law \\\\\\\"`show[s] concern for the life of the unborn,' \\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"prevent[s] cruelty to partially born children,\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*931</span> and \\\\\\\"preserve[s] the integrity of the medical profession.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 48. But we cannot see how the interest-related differences could make any difference to the question at hand, namely, the application of the \\\\\\\"health\\\\\\\" requirement.</p>\\\\n<p>Consequently, the governing standard requires an exception \\\\\\\"where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,\\\\\\\" <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 879, for this Court has made clear that a State may promote but not endanger a woman's health when it regulates the methods of abortion. <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 768-769 (1986); <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 400 (1979); <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 76-79; <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 197 (1973).</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Thomas says that the cases just cited limit this principle to situations where the pregnancy <i>itself</i> creates a threat to health. See <i>post,</i> at 1010. He is wrong. The cited cases, reaffirmed in <i>Casey,</i> recognize that a State cannot subject women's health to significant risks both in that context, <i>and also</i> where state regulations force women to use riskier methods of abortion. Our cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the process of regulating the <i>methods</i> of abortion, imposed significant health risks. They make clear that a risk to a women's health is the same whether it happens to arise from regulating a particular method of abortion, or from barring abortion entirely. Our holding does not go beyond those cases, as ratified in <i>Casey.</i> </p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>Nebraska responds that the law does not require a health exception unless there is a need for such an exception. And here there is no such need, it says. It argues that \\\\\\\"safe alternatives remain available\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"a ban on partial-birth abortion/D&amp;X would create no risk to the health of women.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 29, 40. The problem for Nebraska is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*932</span> that the parties strongly contested this factual question in the trial court below; and the findings and evidence support Dr. Carhart. The State fails to demonstrate that banning D&amp;X without a health exception may not create significant health risks for women, because the record shows that significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, D&amp;X would be the safest procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>We shall reiterate in summary form the relevant findings and evidence. On the basis of medical testimony the District Court concluded that \\\\\\\"Carhart's D&amp;X procedure is . . . safer tha[n] the D&amp;E and other abortion procedures used during the relevant gestational period in the 10 to 20 cases a year that present to Dr. Carhart.\\\\\\\" 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1126. It found that the D&amp;X procedure permits the fetus to pass through the cervix with a minimum of instrumentation. <i>Ibid.</i> It thereby</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"reduces operating time, blood loss and risk of infection; reduces complications from bony fragments; reduces instrument-inflicted damage to the uterus and cervix; prevents the most common causes of maternal mortality (DIC and amniotic fluid embolus); and eliminates the possibility of `horrible complications' arising from retained fetal parts.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </blockquote>\\\\n<p>The District Court also noted that a select panel of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that D&amp;X \\\\\\\"`may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1105, n. 10 (quoting ACOG Statement, App. 600-601) (but see an important qualification, <i>infra,</i> at 934). With one exception, the federal trial courts that have heard expert evidence on the matter have reached similar factual conclusions. See <i>Rhode Island Medical Soc.</i> v. <i>Whitehouse,</i> 66 F.

It says (1) that the D&amp;X procedure is \\\\\\\"little-used,\\\\\\\" (2) by only \\\\\\\"a handful of doctors.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 32. It argues (3) that D&amp;E and labor induction are at all times \\\\\\\"safe alternative procedures.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 36. It refers to the testimony of petitioners' medical expert, who testified (4) that the ban would not increase a woman's risk of several rare abortion complications (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and amniotic fluid embolus), <i>id.,</i> at 37; App. 642-644.</p>\\\\n<p>The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al., <i>amici</i> supporting Nebraska, argue (5) that elements of the D&amp;X procedure may create special risks, including cervical incompetence caused by overdilitation, injury caused by conversion of the fetal presentation, and dangers arising from the \\\\\\\"blind\\\\\\\" use of instrumentation to pierce the fetal skull while lodged in the birth canal. See Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21-23; see also Sprang &amp; Neerhof, Rationale for Banning Abortions Late in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744, 746 (Aug. 26, 1998).</p>\\\\n<p>Nebraska further emphasizes (6) that there are no medical studies \\\\\\\"establishing the safety of the partial-birth abortion/ D&amp;X procedure,\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 39, and \\\\\\\"no medical studies comparing the safety of partial-birth abortion/D&amp;X to other abortion procedures,\\\\\\\" <i>ibid.</i> It points to, <i>id.,</i> at 35, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*934</span> (7) an American Medical Association policy statement that \\\\\\\"`there does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&amp;X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion,' \\\\\\\" Late Term Pregnancy Termination Techniques, AMA Policy H-5.982 (1997). And it points out (8) that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists qualified its statement that D&amp;X \\\\\\\"may be the best or most appropriate procedure,\\\\\\\" by adding that the panel \\\\\\\"could identify no circumstances under which [the D&amp;X] procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.\\\\\\\" App. 600-601.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>3</h2>\\\\n<p>We find these eight arguments insufficient to demonstrate that Nebraska's law needs no health exception. For one thing, certain of the arguments are beside the point. The D&amp;X procedure's relative rarity (argument (1)) is not highly relevant. The D&amp;X is an infrequently used abortion procedure; but the health exception question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception for those infrequent occasions. A rarely used treatment might be necessary to treat a rarely occurring disease that could strike anyone\\u00c2\\u2014the State cannot prohibit a person from obtaining treatment simply by pointing out that most people do not need it. Nor can we know whether the fact that only a \\\\\\\"handful\\\\\\\" of doctors use the procedure (argument (2)) reflects the comparative rarity of late second term abortions, the procedure's recent development, Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, at 1043, the controversy surrounding it, or, as Nebraska suggests, the procedure's lack of utility.</p>\\\\n<p>For another thing, the record responds to Nebraska's (and <i>amici</i>`s) medically based arguments. In respect to argument (3), for example, the District Court agreed that alternatives, such as D&amp;E and induced labor, are \\\\\\\"safe\\\\\\\" but found that the D&amp;X method was significantly <i>safer</i> in certain circumstances. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1125-1126. In respect to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*935</span> argument (4), the District Court simply relied on different expert testimony\\u00c2\\u2014testimony stating that \\\\\\\"`[a]nother advantage of the Intact D&amp;E is that it eliminates the risk of embolism of cerebral tissue into the woman's blood stream.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 1124 (quoting Hearing on H. R. 1833 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 260 (1995) (statement of W. Hern).</p>\\\\n<p>In response to <i>amici</i>`s argument (5), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in its own <i>amici</i> brief, denies that D&amp;X generally poses risks greater than the alternatives. It says that the suggested alternative procedures involve similar or greater risks of cervical and uterine injury, for \\\\\\\"D&amp;E procedures, involve similar amounts of dilitation\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"of course childbirth involves even greater cervical dilitation.\\\\\\\" Brief for American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 23. The College points out that Dr. Carhart does not reposition the fetus thereby avoiding any risks stemming from conversion to breech presentation, and that, as compared with D&amp;X, D&amp;E involves the same, if not greater, \\\\\\\"blind\\\\\\\" use of sharp instruments in the uterine cavity. <i>Id.,</i> at 23-24.</p>\\\\n<p>We do not quarrel with Nebraska's argument (6), for Nebraska is right. There are no general medical studies documenting comparative safety. Neither do we deny the import of the American Medical Association's statement (argument (7))\\u00c2\\u2014even though the State does omit the remainder of that statement: \\\\\\\"The AMA recommends that the procedure not be used <i>unless alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the woman.\\\\\\\"</i> Late Term Pregnancy Termination Techniques, AMA Policy H-5.982 (emphasis added).</p>\\\\n<p>We cannot, however, read the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists panel's qualification (that it could not \\\\\\\"identify\\\\\\\" a circumstance where D&amp;X was the \\\\\\\"only\\\\\\\" life- or health-preserving option) as if, according to Nebraska's argument (8), it denied the potential health-related need <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*936</span> for D&amp;X. That is because the College writes the following in its <i>amici</i> brief:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Depending on the physician's skill and experience, the D&amp;X procedure can be the most appropriate abortion procedure for some women in some circumstances. D&amp;X presents a variety of potential safety advantages over other abortion procedures used during the same gestational period. Compared to D&amp;Es involving dismemberment, D&amp;X involves less risk of uterine perforation or cervical laceration because it requires the physician to make fewer passes into the uterus with sharp instruments and reduces the presence of sharp fetal bone fragments that can injure the uterus and cervix. There is also considerable evidence that D&amp;X reduces the risk of retained fetal tissue, a serious abortion complication that can cause maternal death, and that D&amp;X reduces the incidence of a `free floating' fetal head that can be difficult for a physician to grasp and remove and can thus cause maternal injury. That D&amp;X procedures usually take less time than other abortion methods used at a comparable stage of pregnancy can also have health advantages. The shorter the procedure, the less blood loss, trauma, and exposure to anesthesia. The intuitive safety advantages of intact D&amp;E are supported by clinical experience. Especially for women with particular health conditions, there is medical evidence that D&amp;X may be safer than available alternatives.\\\\\\\" Brief for American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21-22 (citation and footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>4</h2>\\\\n<p>The upshot is a District Court finding that D&amp;X significantly obviates health risks in certain circumstances, a highly plausible record-based explanation of why that might be so, a division of opinion among some medical experts over <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*937</span> whether D&amp;X is generally safer, and an absence of controlled medical studies that would help answer these medical questions. Given these medically related evidentiary circumstances, we believe the law requires a health exception.</p>\\\\n<p>The word \\\\\\\"necessary\\\\\\\" in <i>Casey</i>`s phrase \\\\\\\"necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother,\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted), cannot refer to an absolute necessity or to absolute proof. Medical treatments and procedures are often considered appropriate (or inappropriate) in light of estimated comparative health risks (and health benefits) in particular cases. Neither can that phrase require unanimity of medical opinion. Doctors often differ in their estimation of comparative health risks and appropriate treatment. And <i>Casey</i>`s words \\\\\\\"appropriate medical judgment\\\\\\\" must embody the judicial need to tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion\\u00c2\\u2014differences of a sort that the American Medical Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' statements together indicate are present here.</p>\\\\n<p>For another thing, the division of medical opinion about the matter at most means uncertainty, a factor that signals the presence of risk, not its absence. That division here involves highly qualified knowledgeable experts on both sides of the issue. Where a significant body of medical opinion believes a procedure may bring with it greater safety for some patients and explains the medical reasons supporting that view, we cannot say that the presence of a different view by itself proves the contrary. Rather, the uncertainty means a significant likelihood that those who believe that D&amp;X is a safer abortion method in certain circumstances may turn out to be right. If so, then the absence of a health exception will place women at an unnecessary risk of tragic health consequences. If they are wrong, the exception will simply turn out to have been unnecessary.</p>\\\\n<p>In sum, Nebraska has not convinced us that a health exception is \\\\\\\"never necessary to preserve the health of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*938</span> women.\\\\\\\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 4. Rather, a statute that altogether forbids D&amp;X creates a significant health risk. The statute consequently must contain a health exception. This is not to say, as Justice Thomas and Justice Kennedy claim, that a State is prohibited from proscribing an abortion procedure whenever a particular physician deems the procedure preferable. By no means must a State grant physicians \\\\\\\"unfettered discretion\\\\\\\" in their selection of abortion methods. <i>Post,</i> at 969 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). But where substantial medical authority supports the proposition that banning a particular abortion procedure could endanger women's health, <i>Casey</i> requires the statute to include a health exception when the procedure is \\\\\\\"`necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.' \\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 879. Requiring such an exception in this case is no departure from <i>Casey,</i>  but simply a straightforward application of its holding.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>The Eighth Circuit found the Nebraska statute unconstitutional because, in <i>Casey</i>`s words, it has the \\\\\\\"effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 877<i>.</i> It thereby places an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" upon a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability. <i>Ibid.</i> Nebraska does not deny that the statute imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" <i>if</i> it applies to the more commonly used D&amp;E procedure as well as to D&amp;X. And we agree with the Eighth Circuit that it does so apply.</p>\\\\n<p>Our earlier discussion of the D&amp;E procedure, <i>supra,</i> at 924-926, shows that it falls within the statutory prohibition. The statute forbids \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999). We <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*939</span> do not understand how one could distinguish, using this language, between D&amp;E (where a foot or arm is drawn through the cervix) and D&amp;X (where the body up to the head is drawn through the cervix). Evidence before the trial court makes clear that D&amp;E will often involve a physician pulling a \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" of a stillliving fetus, say, an arm or leg, into the vagina prior to the death of the fetus. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1128; <i>id.,</i> at 1128-1130. Indeed D&amp;E involves dismemberment that commonly occurs only when the fetus meets resistance that restricts the motion of the fetus: \\\\\\\"The dismemberment occurs between the traction of . . . [the] instrument and the counter-traction of the internal so of the cervix.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1128. And these events often do not occur until after a portion of a living fetus has been pulled into the vagina. <i>Id.,</i> at 1104; see also Medical and Surgical Abortion 135 (\\\\\\\"During the mid-second trimester, separation of the fetal corpus may occur when the fetus is drawn into the lower uterine segment, where compression and traction against the endocervix facilitates disarticulation\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Even if the statute's basic aim is to ban D&amp;X, its language makes clear that it also covers a much broader category of procedures. The language does not track the medical differences between D&amp;E and D&amp;X\\u00c2\\u2014though it would have been a simple matter, for example, to provide an exception for the performance of D&amp;E and other abortion procedures. <i>E. g.,</i>  Kan. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 65-6721(b)(1) (Supp. 1999). Nor does the statute anywhere suggest that its application turns on whether a portion of the fetus' body is drawn into the vagina as part of a process to extract an intact fetus after collapsing the head as opposed to a process that would dismember the fetus. Thus, the dissenters' argument that the law was generally intended to bar D&amp;X can be both correct and irrelevant. The relevant question is <i>not</i> whether the legislature wanted to ban D&amp;X; it is whether the law was intended to apply <i>only</i> to D&amp;X. The plain language covers both procedures. A rereading of this opinion, <i>supra,</i> at 924-929, as <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*940</span> well as Justice Thomas' dissent, <i>post,</i> at 984-987, will make clear why we can find no difference, in terms of <i>this</i> statute, between the D&amp;X procedure as described and the D&amp;E procedure as it might be performed. (In particular, compare <i>post,</i> at 984-986 (Thomas, J., dissenting), with <i>post,</i> at 986\\u00c2\\u2014 989 (Thomas, J., dissenting).) Both procedures can involve the introduction of a \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" of a still living fetus, through the cervix, into the vagina\\u00c2\\u2014the very feature of an abortion that leads Justice Thomas to characterize such a procedure as involving \\\\\\\"partial birth.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>The Nebraska State Attorney General argues that the statute does differentiate between the two procedures. He says that the statutory words \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" mean \\\\\\\"the child up to the head.\\\\\\\" He consequently denies the statute's application where the physician introduces into the birth canal a fetal arm or leg or anything less than the entire fetal body. Brief for Petitioners 20. He argues further that we must defer to his views about the meaning of the state statute. <i>Id.,</i> at 12-13.</p>\\\\n<p>We cannot accept the Attorney General's narrowing interpretation of the Nebraska statute. This Court's case law makes clear that we are not to give the Attorney General's interpretative views controlling weight. For one thing, this Court normally follows lower federal-court interpretations of state law. <i>McMillian</i> v. <i>Monroe County,</i>  520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997); <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades,</i>  <i>Inc.,</i> 472 U. S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1985). It \\\\\\\"rarely reviews a construction of state law agreed upon by the two lower federal courts.\\\\\\\" <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U. S. 383, 395 (1988). In this case, the two lower courts have both rejected the Attorney General's narrowing interpretation.</p>\\\\n<p>For another, our precedent warns against accepting as \\\\\\\"authoritative\\\\\\\" an Attorney General's interpretation of state law when \\\\\\\"the Attorney General does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement authorities.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*941</span> Under Nebraska law, the Attorney General's interpretative views do not bind the state courts. <i>State</i> v. <i>Coffman,</i> 213 Neb. 560, 561, 330 N. W. 2d 727, 728 (1983) (Attorney General's issued opinions, while entitled to \\\\\\\"substantial weight\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"to be respectfully considered,\\\\\\\" are of \\\\\\\"no controlling authority\\\\\\\"). Nor apparently do they bind elected county attorneys, to whom Nebraska gives an independent authority to initiate criminal prosecutions. Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 23-1201(1), 28-328(5), 84-205(3) (Supp. 1999); cf. <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 494 U. S. 152, 177 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\\\\\\\"[W]e have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Nor can we say that the lower courts used the wrong legal standard in assessing the Attorney General's interpretation. The Eighth Circuit recognized its \\\\\\\"duty to give [the law] a construction . . . that would avoid constitutional doubts.\\\\\\\" 192 F. 3d, at 1150. It nonetheless concluded that the Attorney General's interpretation would \\\\\\\"twist the words of the law and give them a meaning they cannot reasonably bear.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Eighth Circuit is far from alone in rejecting such a narrowing interpretation. The language in question is based on model statutory language (though some States omit any further definition of \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\"), which 10 lower federal courts have considered on the merits. All 10 of those courts (including the Eighth Circuit) have found the language potentially applicable to other abortion procedures. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, Inc.</i> v. <i>Miller,</i> 195 F. 3d 386 (CA8 1999); <i>Little Rock Family Planning Services</i> v. <i>Jegley,</i> 192 F. 3d 794, 797-798 (CA8 1999); <i>Hope Clinic,</i> 195 F. 3d, at 865-871 (imposing precautionary injunction to prevent application beyond D&amp;X); <i>id.,</i> at 885-889 (Posner, C.

The Attorney General, echoed by the dissents, tries to overcome that language by relying on other language in the statute; in particular, the words \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" a term ordinarily associated with the D&amp;X procedure, and the words \\\\\\\"partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28\\u00c2\\u2014 326(9) (Supp. 1999). But these words cannot help the Attorney General. They are subject to the statute's further <i>explicit statutory definition,</i> specifying that both terms include \\\\\\\"delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition, even if it varies from that term's ordinary meaning. <i>Meese</i> v. <i>Keene,</i> 481 U. S. 465, 484-485 (1987) (\\\\\\\"It is axiomatic that the statutory definition of the term excludes unstated meanings of that term\\\\\\\"); <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i>  439 U. S., at 392-393, n. 10 (\\\\\\\"As a rule, `a definition which declares what a term \\\\\\\"means\\\\\\\" . . . excludes any meaning that is not stated' \\\\\\\"); <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Lenroot,</i> 323 U. S. 490, 502 (1945); <i>Fox</i> v. <i>Standard Oil Co. of N. J.,</i> 294 U. S. 87, 95-96 (1935) (Cardozo, J.); see also 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction \\u00c2\\u00a7 47.07, p. 152, and n. 10 (5th ed. 1992) (collecting cases). That is to say, the statute, read \\\\\\\"as a whole,\\\\\\\" <i>post,</i> at 998 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*943</span> (Thomas, J., dissenting), leads the reader to a definition. That definition does not include the Attorney General's restriction\\u00c2\\u2014\\\\\\\"the child up to the head.\\\\\\\" Its words, \\\\\\\"substantial portion,\\\\\\\" indicate the contrary.</p>\\\\n<p>The Attorney General also points to the Nebraska Legislature's debates, where the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" appeared frequently. But those debates hurt his argument more than they help it. Nebraska's legislators focused directly upon the meaning of the word \\\\\\\"substantial.\\\\\\\" One senator asked the bill's sponsor, \\\\\\\"[Y]ou said that as small a portion of the fetus as a foot would constitute a substantial portion in your opinion. Is that correct?\\\\\\\" The sponsoring senator replied, \\\\\\\"Yes, I believe that's correct.\\\\\\\" App. 452-453; see also <i>id.,</i> at 442-443 (same senator explaining \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" would \\\\\\\"indicate that more than a little bit has been delivered into the vagina,\\\\\\\" <i>i. e.,</i>  \\\\\\\"[e]nough that would allow for the procedure to end up with the killing of the unborn child\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 404 (rejecting amendment to limit law to D&amp;X). The legislature seems to have wanted to avoid more limiting language lest it become too easy to evade the statute's strictures\\u00c2\\u2014a motive that Justice Thomas well explains. <i>Post,</i> at 1001-1003. That goal, however, exacerbates the problem.</p>\\\\n<p>The Attorney General, again echoed by the dissents, further argues that the statute \\\\\\\"distinguishes between the overall `abortion procedure' itself and the separate `procedure' used to kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 16-18; <i>post,</i> at 991-992 (opinion of Thomas, J.), 975-976 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Even assuming that the distinction would help the Attorney General make the D&amp;E/ D&amp;X distinction he seeks, however, we cannot find any language in the statute that supports it. He wants us to read \\\\\\\"procedure\\\\\\\" in the statute's last sentence to mean \\\\\\\"separate procedure,\\\\\\\" <i>i. e.,</i> the killing of the fetus, as opposed to a whole procedure, <i>i. e.,</i> a D&amp;E or D&amp;X abortion. But the critical word \\\\\\\"separate\\\\\\\" is missing. And the same <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*944</span> word \\\\\\\"procedure,\\\\\\\" in the same subsection and throughout the statute, is used to refer to an entire abortion procedure. Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9), 28-328(1)\\u00c2\\u2014(4) (Supp. 1999); cf. <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> 513 U.

They say that introduction of, say, a limb or both limbs into the vagina does not involve \\\\\\\"delivery.\\\\\\\" But obstetric textbooks and even dictionaries routinely use that term to describe any facilitated removal of tissue from the uterus, not only the removal of an intact fetus. <i>E. g.,</i> Obstetrics: Normal &amp; Problem Pregnancies, at 388 (describing \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" of fetal membranes, placenta, and umbilical cord in the third stage of labor); B.

In any event, the statute itself specifies that it applies <i>both</i> to delivering \\\\\\\"an intact unborn child\\\\\\\" <i>or</i> \\\\\\\"a substantial portion thereof.\\\\\\\" The dissents cannot explain how introduction of a substantial portion of a fetus into the vagina pursuant to D&amp;X is a \\\\\\\"delivery,\\\\\\\" while introduction pursuant to D&amp;E is not.</p>\\\\n<p>We are aware that adopting the Attorney General's interpretation might avoid the constitutional problem discussed in this section. But we are \\\\\\\"without power to adopt a narrowing construction of a state statute unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.\\\\\\\" <i>Boos</i> v. <i>Barry,</i> 485 U.

S. 224, 237-239 (1998) (statute must be \\\\\\\"genuinely susceptible\\\\\\\" to two interpretations).</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, the law does not require us to certify the state-law question to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Of course, we lack any authoritative state-court construction. But \\\\\\\"we have never held that a federal litigant must await a statecourt construction or the development of an established practice before bringing the federal suit.\\\\\\\" <i>City of Lakewood</i> v. <i>Plain Dealer Publishing Co.,</i> 486 U.

See Brief for State Appellants in Nos. 98-3245 and 98-3300 (CA8); cf. <i>Arizonans for Official English</i> v. <i>Arizona,</i> 520 U. S. 43 (1997). Even if we were inclined to certify the question now, we cannot do so. Certification of a question (or abstention) is appropriate only where the statute is \\\\\\\"fairly susceptible\\\\\\\" to a narrowing construction, see <i>Houston</i> v. <i>Hill,</i> 482 U. S. 451, 468-471 (1987). We believe it is not. Moreover, the Nebraska Supreme Court grants certification only if the certified question is \\\\\\\"determinative of the cause.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev.

All those who perform abortion procedures using that method must fear prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. The <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*946</span> result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion decision. We must consequently find the statute unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<blockquote>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is <i>Affirmed.</i>  Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Although much ink is spilled today describing the gruesome nature of late-term abortion procedures, that rhetoric does not provide me a <i>reason</i> to believe that the procedure Nebraska here claims it seeks to ban is more brutal, more gruesome, or less respectful of \\\\\\\"potential life\\\\\\\" than the equally gruesome procedure Nebraska claims it still allows. Justice Ginsburg and Judge Posner have, I believe, correctly diagnosed the underlying reason for the enactment of this legislation\\u00c2\\u2014a reason that also explains much of the Court's rhetoric directed at an objective that extends well beyond the narrow issue that this case presents. The rhetoric is almost, but not quite, loud enough to obscure the quiet fact that during the past 27 years, the central holding of <i>Roe</i>  v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), has been endorsed by all but 4 of the 17 Justices who have addressed the issue. That holding\\u00c2\\u2014that the word \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" in the Fourteenth Amendment includes a woman's right to make this difficult and extremely personal decision\\u00c2\\u2014makes it impossible for me to understand how a State has any legitimate interest in requiring a doctor to follow any procedure other than the one that he or she reasonably believes will best protect the woman in her exercise of this constitutional liberty. But one need not even approach this view today to conclude that Nebraska's law must fall. For the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any legitimate interest by banning one but <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*947</span> not the other, is simply irrational. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 14.</p>\\\\n<p>Justice O'Connor, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>The issue of abortion is one of the most contentious and controversial in contemporary American society. It presents extraordinarily difficult questions that, as the Court recognizes, involve \\\\\\\"virtually irreconcilable points of view.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 921. The specific question we face today is whether Nebraska's attempt to proscribe a particular method of abortion, commonly known as \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" is constitutional. For the reasons stated in the Court's opinion, I agree that Nebraska's statute cannot be reconciled with our decision in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and is therefore unconstitutional. I write separately to emphasize the following points.</p>\\\\n<p>First, the Nebraska statute is inconsistent with <i>Casey</i> because it lacks an exception for those instances when the banned procedure is necessary to preserve the health of the mother. See <i>id.,</i> at 879 (plurality opinion). Importantly, Nebraska's own statutory scheme underscores this constitutional infirmity. As we held in <i>Casey,</i> prior to viability \\\\\\\"the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 870. After the fetus has become viable, States may substantially regulate and even proscribe abortion, but any such regulation or proscription must contain an exception for instances \\\\\\\"`where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 879 (quoting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 165 (1973)). Nebraska has recognized this constitutional limitation in its separate statute generally proscribing postviability abortions. See Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-329 (Supp. 1999). That statute provides that \\\\\\\"[n]o abortion shall be performed after the time at which, in the sound medical judgment of the attending physician, the unborn child clearly appears to have reached viability, <i>except when necessary to</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*948</span> <i>preserve the life or health of the mother.</i> \\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). Because even a postviability proscription of abortion would be invalid absent a health exception, Nebraska's ban on previability partial birth abortions, under the circumstances presented here, must include a health exception as well, since the State's interest in regulating abortions before viability is \\\\\\\"considerably weaker\\\\\\\" than after viability. <i>Ante,</i> at 930. The statute at issue here, however, only excepts those procedures \\\\\\\"necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999). This lack of a health exception necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>Contrary to the assertions of Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas, the need for a health exception does not arise from \\\\\\\"the individual views of Dr. Carhart and his supporters.\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 969 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); see also <i>post,</i>  at 1012-1013 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Rather, as the majority explains, where, as here, \\\\\\\"a significant body of medical opinion believes a procedure may bring with it greater safety for some patients and explains the medical reasons supporting that view,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 937, then Nebraska cannot say that the procedure will not, in some circumstances, be \\\\\\\"necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" Accordingly, our precedent requires that the statute include a health exception.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, Nebraska's statute is unconstitutional on the alternative and independent ground that it imposes an undue burden on a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy before viability. Nebraska's ban covers not just the dilation and extraction (D&amp;X) procedure, but also the dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedure, \\\\\\\"the most commonly used method for performing previability second trimester abortions.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 945. The statute defines the banned procedure as \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, <i>or a substantial portion</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*949</span> <i>thereof,</i> for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999) (emphasis added). As the Court explains, the medical evidence establishes that the D&amp;E procedure is included in this definition. Thus, it is not possible to interpret the statute's language as applying only to the D&amp;X procedure. Moreover, it is significant that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals interpreted the statute as prohibiting abortions performed using the D&amp;E method as well as the D&amp;X method. See 192 F. 3d 1142, 1150 (CA8 1999); 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1127-1131 (Neb. 1998). We have stated on several occasions that we ordinarily defer to the construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal courts unless such a construction amounts to plain error. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Bishop</i> v. <i>Wood,</i> 426 U. S. 341, 346 (1976) (\\\\\\\"[T]his Court has accepted the interpretation of state law in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals have concurred even if an examination of the state-law issue without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion\\\\\\\"); <i>The Tungus</i> v. <i>Skovgaard,</i> 358 U. S. 588, 596 (1959). Such deference is not unique to the abortion context, but applies generally to state statutes addressing all areas of the law. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America</i> v. <i>Ward,</i> 526 U. S. 358, 368 (1999) (\\\\\\\"notice-prejudice\\\\\\\" rule in state insurance law); <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U. S. 491, 499 (1985) (moral nuisance law); <i>Runyon</i> v. <i>McCrary,</i> 427 U. S. 160, 181 (1976) (statute of limitations for personal injury actions); <i>Bishop</i> v. <i>Wood, supra,</i> at 346, n. 10 (city employment ordinance). Given this construction, the statute is impermissible. Indeed, Nebraska conceded at oral argument that \\\\\\\"the State could not prohibit the D&amp;E procedure.\\\\\\\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. By proscribing the most commonly used method for previability second trimester abortions, see <i>ante,</i> at 924, the statute creates a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion,\\\\\\\" <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 884, and therefore imposes <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*950</span> an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability.</p>\\\\n<p>It is important to note that, unlike Nebraska, some other States have enacted statutes more narrowly tailored to proscribing the D&amp;X procedure alone. Some of those statutes have done so by specifically excluding from their coverage the most common methods of abortion, such as the D&amp;E and vacuum aspiration procedures. For example, the Kansas statute states that its ban does not apply to the \\\\\\\"(A) [s]uction curettage abortion procedure; (B) suction aspiration abortion procedure; or (C) dilation and evacuation abortion procedure involving dismemberment of the fetus prior to removal from the body of the pregnant woman.\\\\\\\" Kan. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 65\\u00c2\\u2014 6721(b)(2) (Supp. 1998). The Utah statute similarly provides that its prohibition \\\\\\\"does not include the dilation and evacuation procedure involving dismemberment prior to removal, the suction curettage procedure, or the suction aspiration procedure for abortion.\\\\\\\" Utah Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 76-7\\u00c2\\u2014 310.5(1)(a) (1999). Likewise, the Montana statute defines the banned procedure as one in which \\\\\\\"(A) the living fetus is removed intact from the uterus until only the head remains in the uterus; (B) all or a part of the intracranial contents of the fetus are evacuated; (C) the head of the fetus is compressed; and (D) following fetal demise, the fetus is removed from the birth canal.\\\\\\\" Mont. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 50-20\\u00c2\\u2014 401(3)(c)(ii) (Supp. 1999). By restricting their prohibitions to the D&amp;X procedure exclusively, the Kansas, Utah, and Montana statutes avoid a principal defect of the Nebraska law.</p>\\\\n<p>If Nebraska's statute limited its application to the D&amp;X procedure and included an exception for the life and health of the mother, the question presented would be quite different from the one we face today. As we held in <i>Casey,</i> an abortion regulation constitutes an undue burden if it \\\\\\\"has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*951</span> 505 U. S., at 877. If there were adequate alternative methods for a woman safely to obtain an abortion before viability, it is unlikely that prohibiting the D&amp;X procedure alone would \\\\\\\"amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 884. Thus, a ban on partial birth abortion that only proscribed the D&amp;X method of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the life and health of the mother would be constitutional in my view.</p>\\\\n<p>Nebraska's statute, however, does not meet these criteria. It contains no exception for when the procedure, in appropriate medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the health of the mother; and it proscribes not only the D&amp;X procedure but also the D&amp;E procedure, the most commonly used method for previability second trimester abortions, thus making it an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. For these reasons, I agree with the Court that Nebraska's law is unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring.</p>\\\\n<p>I write separately only to stress that amidst all the emotional uproar caused by an abortion case, we should not lose sight of the character of Nebraska's \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" law. As the Court observes, this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only \\\\\\\"a <i>method</i> of performing abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 930. Nor does the statute seek to protect the lives or health of pregnant women. Moreover, as Justice Stevens points out, <i>ante,</i> at 946 (concurring opinion), the most common method of performing previability second trimester abortions is no less distressing or susceptible to gruesome description. Seventh Circuit Chief Judge Posner correspondingly observed, regarding similar bans in Wisconsin and Illinois, that the law prohibits the D&amp;X procedure \\\\\\\"not because the procedure kills the fetus, not because it risks worse complications for the woman <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*952</span> than alternative procedures would do, not because it is a crueler or more painful or more disgusting method of terminating a pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Hope Clinic</i> v. <i>Ryan,</i> 195 F. 3d 857, 881 (CA7 1999) (dissenting opinion). Rather, Chief Judge Posner commented, the law prohibits the procedure because the state legislators seek to chip away at the private choice shielded by <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), even as modified by <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i>  505 U. S. 833 (1992). 195 F. 3d, at 880-882.</p>\\\\n<p>A state regulation that \\\\\\\"has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus\\\\\\\" violates the Constitution. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 877 (plurality opinion). Such an obstacle exists if the State stops a woman from choosing the procedure her doctor \\\\\\\"reasonably believes will best protect the woman in [the] exercise of [her] constitutional liberty.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 946 (Stevens, J., concurring); see <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 877 (\\\\\\\"means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it\\\\\\\"). Again as stated by Chief Judge Posner, \\\\\\\"if a statute burdens constitutional rights and all that can be said on its behalf is that it is the vehicle that legislators have chosen for expressing their hostility to those rights, the burden is undue.\\\\\\\" <i>Hope Clinic,</i> 195 F. 3d, at 881.</p>\\\\n<p>Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>I did not join the joint opinion in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and continue to believe that case is wrongly decided. Despite my disagreement with the opinion, under the rule laid down in <i>Marks</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), the <i>Casey</i>  joint opinion represents the holding of the Court in that case. I believe Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas have correctly applied <i>Casey'</i> s principles and join their dissenting opinions.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*953</span> Justice Scalia, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, <i>Stenberg</i>  v. <i>Carhart</i> will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court's jurisprudence beside <i>Korematsu</i> and <i>Dred Scott.</i> The method of killing a human child\\u00c2\\u2014one cannot even accurately say an entirely unborn human child\\u00c2\\u2014proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion. And the Court must know (as most state legislatures banning this procedure have concluded) that demanding a \\\\\\\"health exception\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014which requires the abortionist to assure himself that, in his expert medical judgment, this method is, in the case at hand, marginally safer than others (how can one prove the contrary beyond a reasonable doubt?)\\u00c2\\u2014is to give live-birth abortion free rein. The notion that the Constitution of the United States, designed, among other things, \\\\\\\"to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, . . . and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,\\\\\\\" prohibits the States from simply banning this visibly brutal means of eliminating our half-born posterity is quite simply absurd.</p>\\\\n<p>Even so, I had not intended to write separately here until the focus of the other separate writings (including the one I have joined) gave me cause to fear that this case might be taken to stand for an error different from the one that it actually exemplifies. Because of the Court's practice of publishing dissents in the order of the seniority of their authors, this writing will appear in the United States Reports before those others, but the reader will not comprehend what follows unless he reads them first.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>The two lengthy dissents in this case have, appropriately enough, set out to establish that today's result does not follow from this Court's most recent pronouncement on the matter of abortion, <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i>  v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992). It would be unfortunate, however, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*954</span> if those who disagree with the result were induced to regard it as merely a regrettable misapplication of <i>Casey.</i>  It is not that, but is <i>Casey</i>`s logical and entirely predictable consequence. To be sure, the Court's construction of this statute so as to make it include procedures other than livebirth abortion involves not only a disregard of fair meaning, but an abandonment of the principle that even ambiguous statutes should be interpreted in such fashion as to render them valid rather than void. <i>Casey</i> does not permit <i>that</i>  jurisprudential novelty\\u00c2\\u2014which must be chalked up to the Court's inclination to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even to speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue. It is of a piece, in other words, with <i>Hill</i> v. <i>Colorado, ante,</i> p. 703, also decided today.</p>\\\\n<p>But the Court gives a second and independent reason for invalidating this humane (not to say antibarbarian) law: That it fails to allow an exception for the situation in which the abortionist believes that this live-birth method of destroying the child might be safer for the woman. (As pointed out by Justice Thomas, and elaborated upon by Justice Kennedy, there is no good reason to believe this is ever the case, but\\u00c2\\u2014who knows?\\u00c2\\u2014it sometime <i>might</i> be.)</p>\\\\n<p>I have joined Justice Thomas's dissent because I agree that today's decision is an \\\\\\\"unprecedented expansio[n]\\\\\\\" of our prior cases, <i>post,</i> at 1012, \\\\\\\"is not mandated\\\\\\\" by <i>Casey</i>`s \\\\\\\"undue-burden\\\\\\\" test, <i>post,</i> at 1010, and can even be called (though this pushes me to the limit of my belief) \\\\\\\"obviously irreconcilable with <i>Casey</i>`s explication of what its undueburden standard requires,\\\\\\\" <i>post,</i> at 983. But I never put much stock in <i>Casey</i>`s explication of the inexplicable. In the last analysis, my judgment that <i>Casey</i> does not support today's tragic result can be traced to the fact that what I consider to be an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" is different from what the majority considers to be an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014a conclusion that cannot be demonstrated true or false by factual inquiry or legal reasoning. It is a value judgment, dependent upon how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect) <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*955</span> the life of a partially delivered fetus, and how much one respects (or believes society ought to respect) the freedom of the woman who gave it life to kill it. Evidently, the five Justices in today's majority value the former less, or the latter more, (or both), than the four of us in dissent. Case closed. There is no cause for anyone who believes in <i>Casey</i>  to feel betrayed by this outcome. It has been arrived at by precisely the process <i>Casey</i> promised\\u00c2\\u2014a democratic vote by nine lawyers, not on the question whether the text of the Constitution has anything to say about this subject (it obviously does not); nor even on the question (also appropriate for lawyers) whether the legal traditions of the American people would have sustained such a limitation upon abortion (they obviously would); but upon the pure policy question whether this limitation upon abortion is \\\\\\\"undue\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014<i>i. e.,</i> goes too far.</p>\\\\n<p>In my dissent in <i>Casey,</i> I wrote that the \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" test made law by the joint opinion created a standard that was \\\\\\\"as doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin,\\\\\\\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 985; \\\\\\\"hopelessly unworkable in practice,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 986; \\\\\\\"ultimately standardless,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 987. Today's decision is the proof. As long as we are debating this issue of necessity for a health-of-the-mother exception on the basis of <i>Casey,</i> it is really quite impossible for us dissenters to contend that the majority is <i>wrong</i> on the law\\u00c2\\u2014 any more than it could be said that one is <i>wrong in law</i> to support or oppose the death penalty, or to support or oppose mandatory minimum sentences. The most that we can honestly say is that we disagree with the majority on their policy-judgment-couched-as-law. And those who believe that a 5-to-4 vote on a policy matter by unelected lawyers should not overcome the judgment of 30 state legislatures have a problem, not with the <i>application</i> of <i>Casey,</i> but with its <i>existence. Casey</i> must be overruled.</p>\\\\n<p>While I am in an I-told-you-so mood, I must recall my bemusement, in <i>Casey,</i> at the majority opinion's expressed belief <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*956</span> that <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 133 (1973), had \\\\\\\"call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\\\\\\\" <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 867, and that the decision in <i>Casey</i> would ratify that happy truce. It seemed to me, quite to the contrary, that \\\\\\\"<i>Roe</i> fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since\\\\\\\"; and that, \\\\\\\"by keeping us in the abortion-umpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that disruption, rather than of any <i>Pax Roeana,</i> that the Court's new majority decrees.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 995-996. Today's decision, that the Constitution of the United States prevents the prohibition of a horrible mode of abortion, will be greeted by a firestorm of criticism\\u00c2\\u2014as well it should. I cannot understand why those who <i>acknowledge</i> that, in the opening words of Justice O'Connor's concurrence, \\\\\\\"[t]he issue of abortion is one of the most contentious and controversial in contemporary American society,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 947, persist in the belief that this Court, armed with neither constitutional text nor accepted tradition, can resolve that contention and controversy rather than be consumed by it. If only for the sake of its own preservation, the Court should return this matter to the people\\u00c2\\u2014where the Constitution, by its silence on the subject, left it\\u00c2\\u2014and let <i>them</i> decide, State by State, whether this practice should be allowed. <i>Casey</i> must be overruled.</p>\\\\n<p>Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>For close to two decades after <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the Court gave but slight weight to the interests of the separate States when their legislatures sought to address persisting concerns raised by the existence of a woman's right to elect an abortion in defined circumstances. When the Court reaffirmed the essential holding of <i>Roe,</i> a central premise was that the States retain a critical and legitimate <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*957</span> role in legislating on the subject of abortion, as limited by the woman's right the Court restated and again guaranteed. <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992). The political processes of the State are not to be foreclosed from enacting laws to promote the life of the unborn and to ensure respect for all human life and its potential. <i>Id.,</i> at 871 (plurality opinion). The State's constitutional authority is a vital means for citizens to address these grave and serious issues, as they must if we are to progress in knowledge and understanding and in the attainment of some degree of consensus.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court's decision today, in my submission, repudiates this understanding by invalidating a statute advancing critical state interests, even though the law denies no woman the right to choose an abortion and places no undue burden upon the right. The legislation is well within the State's competence to enact. Having concluded Nebraska's law survives the scrutiny dictated by a proper understanding of <i>Casey,</i>  I dissent from the judgment invalidating it.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court's failure to accord any weight to Nebraska's interest in prohibiting partial birth abortion is erroneous and undermines its discussion and holding. The Court's approach in this regard is revealed by its description of the abortion methods at issue, which the Court is correct to describe as \\\\\\\"clinically cold or callous.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 923. The majority views the procedures from the perspective of the abortionist, rather than from the perspective of a society shocked when confronted with a new method of ending human life. Words invoked by the majority, such as \\\\\\\"transcervical procedures,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"[o]smotic dilators,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"instrumental disarticulation,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"paracervical block,\\\\\\\" may be accurate and are to some extent necessary, <i>ante,</i> at 924-925; but for citizens who seek to know why laws on this subject have been enacted across the Nation, the words are insufficient. Repeated references <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*958</span> to sources understandable only to a trained physician may obscure matters for persons not trained in medical terminology. Thus it seems necessary at the outset to set forth what may happen during an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>The person challenging Nebraska's law is Dr. Leroy Carhart, a physician who received his medical degree from Hahnemann Hospital and University in 1973. App. 29. Dr. Carhart performs the procedures in a clinic in Nebraska, <i>id.,</i> at 30, and will also travel to Ohio to perform abortions there, <i>id.,</i> at 86. Dr. Carhart has no specialty certifications in a field related to childbirth or abortion and lacks admitting privileges at any hospital. <i>Id.,</i> at 82, 83. He performs abortions throughout pregnancy, including when he is unsure whether the fetus is viable. <i>Id.,</i> at 116. In contrast to the physicians who provided expert testimony in this case (who are board certified instructors at leading medical education institutions and members of the American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), Dr. Carhart performs the partial birth abortion procedure (D&amp;X) that Nebraska seeks to ban. He also performs the other method of abortion at issue in the case, the D&amp;E.</p>\\\\n<p>As described by Dr. Carhart, the D&amp;E procedure requires the abortionist to use instruments to grasp a portion (such as a foot or hand) of a developed and living fetus and drag the grasped portion out of the uterus into the vagina. <i>Id.,</i>  at 61. Dr. Carhart uses the traction created by the opening between the uterus and vagina to dismember the fetus, tearing the grasped portion away from the remainder of the body. <i>Ibid.</i> The traction between the uterus and vagina is essential to the procedure because attempting to abort a fetus without using that traction is described by Dr. Carhart as \\\\\\\"pulling the cat's tail\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"drag[ging] a string across the floor, you'll just keep dragging it. It's not until something grabs the other end that you are going to develop traction.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62. The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*959</span> limb. <i>Id.,</i> at 63. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off. Dr. Carhart agreed that \\\\\\\"[w]hen you pull out a piece of the fetus, let's say, an arm or a leg and remove that, at the time just prior to removal of the portion of the fetus, . . . the fetus [is] alive.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 62. Dr. Carhart has observed fetal heartbeat via ultrasound with \\\\\\\"extensive parts of the fetus removed,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 64, and testified that mere dismemberment of a limb does not always cause death because he knows of a physician who removed the arm of a fetus only to have the fetus go on to be born \\\\\\\"as a living child with one arm.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 63. At the conclusion of a D&amp;E abortion no intact fetus remains. In Dr. Carhart's words, the abortionist is left with \\\\\\\"a tray full of pieces.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 125.</p>\\\\n<p>The other procedure implicated today is called \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" or the D&amp;X. The D&amp;X can be used, as a general matter, after 19 weeks' gestation because the fetus has become so developed that it may survive intact partial delivery from the uterus into the vagina. <i>Id.,</i> at 61. In the D&amp;X, the abortionist initiates the woman's natural delivery process by causing the cervix of the woman to be dilated, sometimes over a sequence of days. <i>Id.,</i> at 492. The fetus' arms and legs are delivered outside the uterus while the fetus is alive; witnesses to the procedure report seeing the body of the fetus moving outside the woman's body. Brief for Petitioners 4. At this point, the abortion procedure has the appearance of a live birth. As stated by one group of physicians, \\\\\\\"[a]s the physician manually performs breech extraction of the body of a live fetus, excepting the head, she continues in the apparent role of an obstetrician delivering a child.\\\\\\\" Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 27. With only the head of the fetus remaining in utero, the abortionist tears open the skull. According to Dr. Martin Haskell, a leading proponent of the procedure, the appropriate instrument to be used at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*960</span> this stage of the abortion is a pair of scissors. M. Haskell, Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion (1992), in 139 Cong. Rec. 8605 (1993). Witnesses report observing the portion of the fetus outside the woman react to the skull penetration. Brief for Petitioners 4. The abortionist then inserts a suction tube and vacuums out the developing brain and other matter found within the skull. The process of making the size of the fetus' head smaller is given the clinically neutral term \\\\\\\"reduction procedure.\\\\\\\" 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1106 (Neb. 1998). Brain death does not occur until after the skull invasion, and, according to Dr. Carhart, the heart of the fetus may continue to beat for minutes after the contents of the skull are vacuumed out. App. 58. The abortionist next completes the delivery of a dead fetus, intact except for the damage to the head and the missing contents of the skull.</p>\\\\n<p>Of the two described procedures, Nebraska seeks only to ban the D&amp;X. In light of the description of the D&amp;X procedure, it should go without saying that Nebraska's ban on partial birth abortion furthers purposes States are entitled to pursue. Dr. Carhart nevertheless maintains the State has no legitimate interest in forbidding the D&amp;X. As he interprets the controlling cases in this Court, the only two interests the State may advance through regulation of abortion are in the health of the woman who is considering the procedure and in the life of the fetus she carries. Brief for Respondent 45. The Court, as I read its opinion, accedes to his views, misunderstanding <i>Casey</i> and the authorities it confirmed.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Casey</i> held that cases decided in the wake of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i>  410 U. S. 113 (1973), had \\\\\\\"given [state interests] too little acknowledgment and implementation.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). The decision turned aside any contention that a person has the \\\\\\\"right to decide whether to have an abortion without `interference from the State,' \\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 875, and rejected a strict scrutiny standard of review as \\\\\\\"incompatible <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*961</span> with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 876. \\\\\\\"The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> We held it was inappropriate for the Judicial Branch to provide an exhaustive list of state interests implicated by abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 877.</p>\\\\n<p><i>Casey</i> is premised on the States having an important constitutional role in defining their interests in the abortion debate. It is only with this principle in mind that Nebraska's interests can be given proper weight. The State's brief describes its interests as including concern for the life of the unborn and \\\\\\\"for the partially-born,\\\\\\\" in preserving the integrity of the medical profession, and in \\\\\\\"erecting a barrier to infanticide.\\\\\\\" Brief for Petitioners 48-49. A review of <i>Casey</i> demonstrates the legitimacy of these policies. The Court should say so.</p>\\\\n<p>States may take sides in the abortion debate and come down on the side of life, even life in the unborn:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules and regulations designed to encourage [a woman] to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child herself.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 872 (plurality opinion).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>States also have an interest in forbidding medical procedures which, in the State's reasonable determination, might cause the medical profession or society as a whole to become insensitive, even disdainful, to life, including life in the human fetus. Abortion, <i>Casey</i> held, has consequences beyond the woman and her fetus. The States' interests in regulating <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*962</span> are of concomitant extension. <i>Casey</i> recognized that abortion is \\\\\\\"fraught with consequences for . . . the persons who perform and assist in the procedure [and for] society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 852 (majority opinion).</p>\\\\n<p>A State may take measures to ensure the medical profession and its members are viewed as healers, sustained by a compassionate and rigorous ethic and cognizant of the dignity and value of human life, even life which cannot survive without the assistance of others. <i>Ibid.; </i><i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i> 521 U. S. 702, 730-734 (1997).</p>\\\\n<p><i>Casey</i> demonstrates that the interests asserted by the State are legitimate and recognized by law. It is argued, however, that a ban on the D&amp;X does not further these interests. This is because, the reasoning continues, the D&amp;E method, which Nebraska claims to be beyond its intent to regulate, can still be used to abort a fetus and is no less dehumanizing than the D&amp;X method. While not adopting the argument in express terms, the Court indicates tacit approval of it by refusing to reject it in a forthright manner. Rendering express what is only implicit in the majority opinion, Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg are forthright in declaring that the two procedures are indistinguishable and that Nebraska has acted both irrationally and without a proper purpose in enacting the law. The issue is not whether members of the judiciary can see a difference between the two procedures. It is whether Nebraska can. The Court's refusal to recognize Nebraska's right to declare a moral difference between the procedures is a dispiriting disclosure of the illogic and illegitimacy of the Court's approach to the entire case.</p>\\\\n<p>Nebraska was entitled to find the existence of a consequential moral difference between the procedures. We are referred to substantial medical authority that D&amp;X perverts <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*963</span> the natural birth process to a greater degree than D&amp;E, commandeering the live birth process until the skull is pierced. American Medical Association (AMA) publications describe the D&amp;X abortion method as \\\\\\\"ethically wrong.\\\\\\\" AMA Board of Trustees Factsheet on HR 1122 (June 1997), in App. to Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1 (AMA Factsheet). The D&amp;X differs from the D&amp;E because in the D&amp;X the fetus is \\\\\\\"killed <i>outside</i> of the womb\\\\\\\" where the fetus has \\\\\\\"an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also App. 639-640; Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 27 (\\\\\\\"Intact D&amp;X is aberrant and troubling because the technique confuses the disparate role of a physician in childbirth and abortion in such a way as to blur the medical, legal, and ethical line between infanticide and abortion\\\\\\\"). Witnesses to the procedure relate that the fingers and feet of the fetus are moving prior to the piercing of the skull; when the scissors are inserted in the back of the head, the fetus' body, wholly outside the woman's body and alive, reacts as though startled and goes limp. D&amp;X's stronger resemblance to infanticide means Nebraska could conclude the procedure presents a greater risk of disrespect for life and a consequent greater risk to the profession and society, which depend for their sustenance upon reciprocal recognition of dignity and respect. The Court is without authority to second-guess this conclusion.</p>\\\\n<p>Those who oppose abortion would agree, indeed would insist, that both procedures are subject to the most severe moral condemnation, condemnation reserved for the most repulsive human conduct. This is not inconsistent, however, with the further proposition that as an ethical and moral matter D&amp;X is distinct from D&amp;E and is a more serious concern for medical ethics and the morality of the larger society the medical profession must serve. Nebraska must obey the legal regime which has declared the right of the woman to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*964</span> have an abortion before viability. Yet it retains its power to adopt regulations which do not impose an undue burden on the woman's right. By its regulation, Nebraska instructs all participants in the abortion process, including the mother, of its moral judgment that all life,including the life of the unborn, is to be respected. The participants, Nebraska has determined, cannot be indifferent to the procedure used and must refrain from using the natural delivery process to kill the fetus. The differentiation between the procedures is itself a moral statement, serving to promote respect for human life; and if the woman and her physician in contemplating the moral consequences of the prohibited procedure conclude that grave moral consequences pertain to the permitted abortion process as well, the choice to elect or not to elect abortion is more informed; and the policy of promoting respect for life is advanced.</p>\\\\n<p>It ill-serves the Court, its institutional position, and the constitutional sources it seeks to invoke to refuse to issue a forthright affirmation of Nebraska's right to declare that critical moral differences exist between the two procedures. The natural birth process has been appropriated; yet the Court refuses to hear the State's voice in defining its interests in its law. The Court's holding contradicts <i>Casey</i>`s assurance that the State's constitutional position in the realm of promoting respect for life is more than marginal.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Demonstrating a further and basic misunderstanding of <i>Casey,</i> the Court holds the ban on the D&amp;X procedure fails because it does not include an exception permitting an abortionist to perform a D&amp;X whenever he believes it will best preserve the health of the woman. Casting aside the views of distinguished physicians and the statements of leading medical organizations, the Court awards each physician a veto power over the State's judgment that the procedures should not be performed. Dr. Carhart has made the medical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*965</span> judgment to use the D&amp;X procedure in every case, regardless of indications, after 15 weeks' gestation. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105. Requiring Nebraska to defer to Dr. Carhart's judgment is no different from forbidding Nebraska from enacting a ban at all; for it is now Dr. Leroy Carhart who sets abortion policy for the State of Nebraska, not the legislature or the people. <i>Casey</i> does not give precedence to the views of a single physician or a group of physicians regarding the relative safety of a particular procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>I am in full agreement with Justice Thomas that the appropriate <i>Casey</i> inquiry is not, as the Court would have it, whether the State is preventing an abortionist from doing something that, in his medical judgment, he believes to be the most appropriate course of treatment. <i>Post,</i> at 1009\\u00c2\\u2014 1013. <i>Casey</i> addressed the question \\\\\\\"whether the State can resolve . . . philosophic questions [about abortion] in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 850. We decided the issue against the State, holding that a woman cannot be deprived of the opportunity to make reproductive decisions. <i>Id.,</i> at 860. <i>Casey</i> made it quite evident, however, that the State has substantial concerns for childbirth and the life of the unborn and may enact laws \\\\\\\"which in no real sense depriv[e] women of the ultimate decision.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 875 (plurality opinion). Laws having the \\\\\\\"purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus\\\\\\\" are prohibited. <i>Id.,</i> at 877. Nebraska's law does not have this purpose or effect.</p>\\\\n<p>The holding of <i>Casey,</i> allowing a woman to elect abortion in defined circumstances, is not in question here. Nebraska, however, was entitled to conclude that its ban, while advancing important interests regarding the sanctity of life, deprived no woman of a safe abortion and therefore did not impose a substantial obstacle on the rights of any woman. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) \\\\\\\"could identify no circumstances under which [D&amp;X] <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*966</span> would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.\\\\\\\" App. 600-601. The AMA agrees, stating the \\\\\\\"AMA's expert panel, which included an ACOG representative, could not find `any' identified circumstance where it was `the only appropriate alternative.' \\\\\\\" AMA Factsheet 1. The Court's conclusion that the D&amp;X is the safest method requires it to replace the words \\\\\\\"may be\\\\\\\" with the word \\\\\\\"is\\\\\\\" in the following sentence from ACOG's position statement: \\\\\\\"An intact D&amp;X, however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance.\\\\\\\" App. 600-601.</p>\\\\n<p>No studies support the contention that the D&amp;X abortion method is safer than other abortion methods. Brief for Respondent 36, n. 41. Leading proponents of the procedure acknowledge that the D&amp;X has \\\\\\\"disadvantages\\\\\\\" versus other methods because it requires a high degree of surgical skill to pierce the skull with a sharp instrument in a blind procedure. Haskell, 139 Cong. Rec. 8605 (1993). Other doctors point to complications that may arise from the D&amp;X. Brief for American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 21-23; App. 186. A leading physician, Frank Boehm, M. D., who has performed and supervised abortions as director of the Fetal Intensive Care Unit and the Maternal/Fetal Medicine Division at Vanderbilt University Hospital, has refused to support use of the D&amp;X, both because no medical need for the procedure exists and because of ethical concerns. <i>Id.,</i> at 636, 639-640, 656-657. Dr. Boehm, a fellow of ACOG, <i>id.,</i> at 565, supports abortion rights and has provided sworn testimony in opposition to previous state attempts to regulate abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 608-614.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court cannot conclude the D&amp;X is part of standard medical practice. It is telling that no expert called by Dr. Carhart, and no expert testifying in favor of the procedure, had in fact performed a partial birth abortion in his or her medical practice. <i>E. g., id.,</i> at 308 (testimony of Dr. Phillip Stubble field). In this respect their opinions were <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*967</span> courtroom conversions of uncertain reliability. Litigation in other jurisdictions establishes that physicians do not adopt the D&amp;X procedure as part of standard medical practice. <i>E. g., </i><i>Richmond Medical Center for Women</i> v. <i>Gilmore,</i> 144 F. 3d 326, 328 (CA4 1998); <i>Hope Clinic</i> v. <i>Ryan,</i> 195 F. 3d 857, 871 (CA7 1999); see also App. 603-604. It is quite wrong for the Court to conclude, as it seems to have done here, that Dr. Carhart conforms his practice to the proper standard of care because he has incorporated the procedure into his practice. Neither Dr. Boehm nor Dr. Carhart's lead expert, Dr. Stubblefield (the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine and director of obstetrics and gynecology for the Boston Medical Center), has done so.</p>\\\\n<p>Substantial evidence supports Nebraska's conclusion that its law denies no woman a safe abortion. The most to be said for the D&amp;X is it may present an unquantified lower risk of complication for a particular patient but that other proven safe procedures remain available even for this patient. Under these circumstances, the Court is wrong to limit its inquiry to the relative physical safety of the two procedures, with the slightest potential difference requiring the invalidation of the law. As Justice O'Connor explained in an earlier case, the State may regulate based on matters beyond \\\\\\\"what various medical organizations have to say about the <i>physical</i> safety of a particular procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 467 (1983) (dissenting opinion). Where the difference in physical safety is, at best, marginal, the State may take into account the grave moral issues presented by a new abortion method. See <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 880 (requiring a regulation to impose a \\\\\\\"significant threat to the life or health of a woman\\\\\\\" before its application would impose an undue burden (internal quotation marks omitted)). Dr. Carhart does not decide to use the D&amp;X based on a conclusion that it is best for a particular woman. Unsubstantiated and generalized <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*968</span> health differences which are, at best, marginal, do not amount to a substantial obstacle to the abortion right. <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 876 (plurality opinion). It is also important to recognize that the D&amp;X is effective only when the fetus is close to viable or, in fact, viable; thus the State is regulating the process at the point where its interest in life is nearing its peak.</p>\\\\n<p>Courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the relative worth of particular surgical procedures. The legislatures of the several States have superior factfinding capabilities in this regard. In an earlier case, Justice O'Connor had explained that the general rule extends to abortion cases, writing that the Court is not suited to be \\\\\\\"the Nation's <i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 456 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). \\\\\\\"Irrespective of the difficulty of the task, legislatures, with their superior fact finding capabilities, are certainly better able to make the necessary judgments than are courts.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 456, n. 4. Nebraska's judgment here must stand.</p>\\\\n<p>In deferring to the physician's judgment, the Court turns back to cases decided in the wake of <i>Roe,</i> cases which gave a physician's treatment decisions controlling weight. Before it was repudiated by <i>Casey,</i> the approach of deferring to physicians had reached its apex in <i>Akron, supra,</i> where the Court held an informed consent requirement was unconstitutional. The law challenged in <i>Akron</i> required the abortionist to inform the woman of the status of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies to provide assistance and information. <i>Id.,</i> at 442. The physician was also required to advise the woman of the risks associated with the abortion technique to be employed and other information. <i>Ibid.</i> The law was invalidated based on the physician's <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*969</span> right to practice medicine in the way he or she saw fit; for, according to the <i>Akron</i> Court, \\\\\\\"[i]t remains primarily the responsibility of the physician to ensure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient, depending on her particular circumstances.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 443. Dispositive for the Court was that the law was an \\\\\\\"intrusion upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 445. The physician was placed in an \\\\\\\"undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court's decision today echoes the <i>Akron</i> Court's deference to a physician's right to practice medicine in the way he or she sees fit.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court, of course, does not wish to cite <i>Akron;</i> yet the Court's holding is indistinguishable from the reasoning in <i>Akron</i> that <i>Casey</i> repudiated. No doubt exists that today's holding is based on a physician-first view which finds its primary support in that now-discredited case. Rather than exalting the right of a physician to practice medicine with unfettered discretion, <i>Casey</i> recognized: \\\\\\\"Whatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it is derivative of the woman's position.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 884 (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). <i>Casey</i> discussed the informed consent requirement struck down in <i>Akron</i> and held <i>Akron</i> was wrong. The doctor-patient relation was only \\\\\\\"entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 884. The standard of medical practice cannot depend on the individual views of Dr. Carhart and his supporters. The question here is whether there was substantial and objective medical evidence to demonstrate the State had considerable support for its conclusion that the ban created a substantial risk to no woman's health. <i>Casey</i> recognized the point, holding the physician's ability to practice medicine was \\\\\\\"subject to reasonable . . . regulation by the State\\\\\\\" and would receive the \\\\\\\"same solicitude it receives in other contexts.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> In other contexts, the State is entitled <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*970</span> to make judgments where high medical authority is in disagreement.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court fails to acknowledge substantial authority allowing the State to take sides in a medical debate, even when fundamental liberty interests are at stake and even when leading members of the profession disagree with the conclusions drawn by the legislature. In <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U. S. 346 (1997), we held that disagreements among medical professionals \\\\\\\"do not tie the State's hands in setting the bounds of . . . laws. In fact, it is precisely where such disagreement exists that legislatures have been afforded the widest latitude.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 360, n. 3. Instead, courts must exercise caution (rather than require deference to the physician's treatment decision) when medical uncertainty is present. <i>Ibid.</i> (\\\\\\\"[W]hen a legislature `undertakes to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, legislative options must be especially broad and courts should be cautious not to rewrite legislation' \\\\\\\") (quoting <i>Jones</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 463 U. S. 354, 370 (1983)); see also <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 223 U. S. 288, 297-298 (1912) (Holmes, J.) (declaring the \\\\\\\"right of the state to adopt a policy even upon medical matters concerning which there is difference of opinion and dispute\\\\\\\"); <i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Yellowley,</i> 272 U. S. 581, 596\\u00c2\\u2014 597 (1926) (rejecting claim of distinguished physician because \\\\\\\"[h]igh medical authority being in conflict . . . , it would, indeed, be strange if Congress lacked the power [to act]\\\\\\\"); <i>Marshall</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974) (recognizing \\\\\\\"there is no agreement among members of the medical profession\\\\\\\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rutherford,</i> 442 U. S. 544 (1979) (discussing regulatory approval process for certain drugs).</p>\\\\n<p>Instructive is <i>Jacobson</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 197 U. S. 11 (1905), where the defendant was convicted because he refused to undergo a smallpox vaccination. The defendant claimed the mandatory vaccination violated his liberty to \\\\\\\"care for his own body and health in such way as to him <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*971</span> seems best.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 26. He offered to prove that members of the medical profession took the position that the vaccination was of no value and, in fact, was harmful. <i>Id.,</i> at 30. The Court rejected the claim, establishing beyond doubt the right of the legislature to resolve matters upon which physicians disagreed:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Those offers [of proof by the defendant] in the main seem to have had no purpose except to state the general theory of those of the medical profession who attach little or no value to vaccination as a means of preventing the spread of smallpox, or who think that vaccination causes other diseases of the body. What everybody knows the court must know, and therefore the state court judicially knew, as this court knows, that an opposite theory accords with the common belief, and is maintained by high medical authority. We must assume that, when the statute in question was passed, the legislature of Massachusetts was not unaware of these opposing theories, and was compelled, of necessity, to choose between them. It was not compelled to commit a matter involving the public health and safety to the final decision of a court or jury. It is no part of the function of a court or a jury to determine which one of two modes was likely to be the most effective for the protection of the public against disease. That was for the legislative department to determine in the light of all the information it had or could obtain. It could not properly abdicate its function to guard the public health and safety.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </blockquote>\\\\n<p>The <i>Jacobson</i> Court quoted with approval a recent statecourt decision which observed, in words having full application today:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The fact that the belief is not universal [in the medical community] is not controlling, for there is scarcely any belief that is accepted by everyone. The possibility that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*972</span> the belief may be wrong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong, is not conclusive; for the legislature has the right to pass laws which, according to common belief of the people, are adapted to [address medical matters]. In a free country, where government is by the people, through their chosen representatives, practical legislation admits of no other standard of action.' \\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 35 (quoting <i>Viemester</i> v. <i>White,</i> 179 N. Y. 235, 241, 72 N. E. 97, 99 (1904)).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Justice O'Connor assures the people of Nebraska they are free to redraft the law to include an exception permitting the D&amp;X to be performed when \\\\\\\"the procedure, in appropriate medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 951. The assurance is meaningless. She has joined an opinion which accepts that Dr. Carhart exercises \\\\\\\"appropriate medical judgment\\\\\\\" in using the D&amp;X for every patient in every procedure, regardless of indications, after 15 weeks' gestation. <i>Ante,</i> at 937 (requiring any health exception to \\\\\\\"tolerate responsible differences of medical opinion\\\\\\\" which \\\\\\\"are present here\\\\\\\"). A ban which depends on the \\\\\\\"appropriate medical judgment\\\\\\\" of Dr. Carhart is no ban at all. He will be unaffected by any new legislation. This, of course, is the vice of a health exception resting in the physician's discretion.</p>\\\\n<p>In light of divided medical opinion on the propriety of the partial birth abortion technique (both in terms of physical safety and ethical practice) and the vital interests asserted by Nebraska in its law, one is left to ask what the first Justice Harlan asked: \\\\\\\"Upon what sound principles as to the relations existing between the different departments of government can the court review this action of the legislature?\\\\\\\" <i>Jacobson, supra,</i> at 31. The answer is none.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The Court's next holding is that Nebraska's ban forbids both the D&amp;X procedure and the more common D&amp;E procedure. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*973</span> In so ruling the Court misapplies settled doctrines of statutory construction and contradicts <i>Casey</i>`s premise that the States have a vital constitutional position in the abortion debate. I agree with the careful statutory analysis conducted by Justice Thomas, <i>post,</i> at 989-1005. Like the ruling requiring a physician veto, requiring a State to meet unattainable standards of statutory draftsmanship in order to have its voice heard on this grave and difficult subject is no different from foreclosing state participation altogether.</p>\\\\n<p>Nebraska's statute provides:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"No partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The statute defines \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" as</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"an abortion procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>It further defines \\\\\\\"partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child\\\\\\\" to mean</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </blockquote>\\\\n<p>The text demonstrates the law applies only to the D&amp;X procedure. Nebraska's intention is demonstrated at three points in the statutory language: references to \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion\\\\\\\" and to the \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" of a fetus; and the requirement <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*974</span> that the delivery occur \\\\\\\"before\\\\\\\" the performance of the death-causing procedure.</p>\\\\n<p>The term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" means an abortion performed using the D&amp;X method as described above. The Court of Appeals acknowledged the term \\\\\\\"is commonly understood to refer to a particular procedure known as intact dilation and extraction (D&amp;X).\\\\\\\" <i>Little Rock Family Planning Servs.</i> v. <i>Jegley,</i> 192 F. 3d 794, 795 (CA8 1999). Dr. Carhart's own lead expert, Dr. Phillip Stubblefield, prefaced his description of the D&amp;X procedure by describing it as the procedure \\\\\\\"which, in the lay press, has been called a partial-birth abortion.\\\\\\\" App. 271-272. And the AMA has declared: \\\\\\\"The `partial birth abortion' legislation is by its very name aimed exclusively [at the D&amp;X.] There is no other abortion procedure which could be confused with that description.\\\\\\\" AMA Factsheet 3. A commonsense understanding of the statute's reference to \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion\\\\\\\" demonstrates its intended reach and provides all citizens the fair warning required by the law. <i>McBoyle</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931).</p>\\\\n<p>The statute's intended scope is demonstrated by its requirement that the banned procedure include a partial \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" of the fetus into the vagina and the completion of a \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" at the end of the procedure. Only removal of an intact fetus can be described as a \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" of a fetus and only the D&amp;X involves an intact fetus. In a D&amp;E, portions of the fetus are pulled into the vagina with the intention of dismembering the fetus by using the traction at the opening between the uterus and vagina. This cannot be considered a delivery of a portion of a fetus. In Dr. Carhart's own words, the D&amp;E leaves the abortionist with a \\\\\\\"tray full of pieces,\\\\\\\" App. 125, at the end of the procedure. Even if it could be argued, as the majority does, <i>ante,</i> at 944, that dragging a portion of an intact fetus into the vagina as the first step of a D&amp;E is a delivery of that portion of an intact fetus, the D&amp;E still does not involve \\\\\\\"completing the delivery\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*975</span> of an intact fetus. Whatever the statutory term \\\\\\\"completing the delivery\\\\\\\" of an unborn child means, it cannot mean, as the Court would have it, placing fetal remains on a tray. See <i>Planned Parenthood of Wis.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 9 F. Supp. 2d 1033, 1041 (WD Wis. 1998) (the statute is \\\\\\\"readily applied to the partial delivery of an intact child but hardly applicable to the delivery of dismembered body parts\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>Medical descriptions of the abortion procedures confirm the point, for it is only the description of the D&amp;X that invokes the word \\\\\\\"delivery.\\\\\\\" App. 600. The United States, as <i>amicus,</i> cannot bring itself to describe the D&amp;E as involving a \\\\\\\"delivery,\\\\\\\" instead substituting the word \\\\\\\"emerges\\\\\\\" to describe how the fetus is brought into the vagina in a D&amp;E. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10. The Court, in a similar admission, uses the words \\\\\\\"a physician pulling\\\\\\\" a portion of a fetus, <i>ante,</i> at 939, rather than a \\\\\\\"physician delivering\\\\\\\" a portion of a fetus; yet only a procedure involving a delivery is banned by the law. Of all the definitions of \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" provided by the Court, <i>ante,</i> at 944, not one supports (or, more important for statutory construction purposes, requires) the conclusion that the statutory term \\\\\\\"completing the delivery\\\\\\\" refers to the placement of dismembered body parts on a tray rather than the removal of an intact fetus from the woman's body.</p>\\\\n<p>The operation of Nebraska's law is further defined by the requirement that the fetus be partially delivered into the vagina \\\\\\\"before\\\\\\\" the abortionist kills it. The partial delivery must be undertaken \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person . . . knows will kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (Supp. 1999). The law is most naturally read to require the death of the fetus to take place in two steps: First the fetus must be partially delivered into the vagina and then the defendant must perform a death-causing procedure. In a D&amp;E, forcing the fetus into the vagina (the pulling of extremities off the body in the process of extracting the body parts from the uterus into the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*976</span> vagina) is also the procedure that kills the fetus. <i>Richmond Medical Center for Women</i> v. <i>Gilmore,</i> 144 F. 3d, at 330 (order of Luttig, J.). In a D&amp;X, the fetus is partially delivered into the vagina before a separate procedure (the socalled \\\\\\\"reduction procedure\\\\\\\") is performed in order to kill the fetus.</p>\\\\n<p>The majority rejects this argument based on its conclusion that the word \\\\\\\"procedure\\\\\\\" must \\\\\\\"refer to an entire abortion procedure\\\\\\\" each time it is used. <i>Ante,</i> at 944. This interpretation makes no sense. It would require us to conclude that the Nebraska Legislature considered the \\\\\\\"entire abortion procedure\\\\\\\" to take place after the abortionist has already delivered into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof. Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28\\u00c2\\u2014 326(9) (Supp. 1999). All medical authorities agree, however, that the entire abortion procedure begins several days before this stage, with the dilation of the cervix. The majority asks us, in effect, to replace the words \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing\\\\\\\" with the words \\\\\\\"in the course of performing\\\\\\\" in the portion of \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) quoted in the preceding paragraph. The reference to \\\\\\\"procedure\\\\\\\" refers to the separate deathcausing procedure that is unique to the D&amp;X.</p>\\\\n<p>In light of the statutory text, the commonsense understanding must be that the statute covers only the D&amp;X. See <i>Broadrick</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 413 U. S. 601, 698 (1973). The AMA does not disagree. It writes: \\\\\\\"The partial birth abortion legislation is by its very name aimed exclusively at a procedure by which a living fetus is intentionally and deliberately given partial birth and delivered for the purpose of killing it. There is no other abortion procedure which could be confused with that description.\\\\\\\" AMA Factsheet 3 (internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Casey</i> disavows strict scrutiny review; and Nebraska must be afforded leeway when attempting to regulate the medical profession. See <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U. S., at 359 (\\\\\\\"[W]e have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining terms of a medical <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*977</span> nature that have legal significance\\\\\\\"). To hold the statute covers the D&amp;E, the Court must disagree with the AMA and disregard the known intent of the legislature, adequately expressed in the statute.</p>\\\\n<p>Strained statutory constructions in abortion cases are not new, for Justice O'Connor identified years ago \\\\\\\"an unprecedented canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute is to be avoided at all costs.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 829 (1986) (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). <i>Casey</i> banished this doctrine from our jurisprudence; yet the Court today reinvigorates it and, in the process, ignores its obligation to interpret the law in a manner to validate it, not render it void. <i>E. g., </i><i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Robison,</i> 415 U. S. 361, 366\\u00c2\\u2014 367 (1974); <i>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</i> v. <i>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council,</i> 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). Avoidance of unconstitutional constructions is discussed only in two sentences of the Court's analysis and dismissed as inapplicable because the statute is not susceptible to the construction offered by the Nebraska Attorney General. <i>Ante,</i>  at 944-945. For the reasons here discussed, the statute is susceptible to the construction; and the Court is required to adopt it.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court and Justice O'Connor seek to shield themselves from criticism by citing the interpretations of the partial birth abortion statutes offered by some other federal courts. <i>Ante,</i> at 941-942. On this issue of nationwide importance, these courts have no special competence; and of appellate courts to consider similar statutes, a majority have, in contrast to the Court, declared that the law could be interpreted to cover only the D&amp;X. See <i>Hope Clinic,</i> 195 F. 3d, at 865-871; <i>Richmond Medical Center, supra,</i> at 330-332 (order of Luttig, J.). Thirty States have enacted similar laws. It is an abdication of responsibility for the Court to suggest its hands are tied by decisions which paid scant attention <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*978</span> to <i>Casey</i>`s recognition of the State's authority and misapplied the doctrine of construing statutes to avoid constitutional difficulty. Further, the leading case describing the deference argument, <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474, 483 (1988), declined to defer to a lower court construction of the state statute at issue in the case. As <i>Frisby</i> observed, the \\\\\\\"lower courts ran afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.\\\\\\\" See also <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490, 514 (1989) (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); <i>id.,</i> at 525 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\\\\n<p>The majority and, even more so, the concurring opinion by Justice O'Connor, ignore the settled rule against deciding unnecessary constitutional questions. The State of Nebraska conceded, under its understanding of <i>Casey,</i> that if this law must be interpreted to bar D&amp;E as well as D&amp;X it is unconstitutional. Since the majority concludes this is indeed the case, that should have been the end of the matter. Yet the Court and Justice O'Connor go much further. They conclude that the statute requires a health exception which, for all practical purposes and certainly in the circumstances of this case, allows the physician to make the determination in his own professional judgment. This is an immense constitutional holding. It is unnecessary; and, for the reasons I have sought to explain, it is incorrect. While it is not clear which of the two halves of the majority opinion is <i>dictum,</i> both are wrong.</p>\\\\n<p>The United States District Court in this case leaped to prevent the law from being enforced, granting an injunction before it was applied or interpreted by Nebraska. Cf. <i>Hill</i>  v. <i>Colorado, ante,</i> p. 703. In so doing, the court excluded from the abortion debate not just the Nebraska legislative branch but the State's executive and judiciary as well. The law was enjoined before the chief law enforcement officer <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*979</span> of the State, its Attorney General, had any opportunity to interpret it. The federal court then ignored the representations made by that officer during this litigation. In like manner, Nebraska's courts will be given no opportunity to define the contours of the law, although by all indications those courts would give the statute a more narrow construction than the one so eagerly adopted by the Court today. <i>E. g., </i><i>Stenberg</i> v. <i>Moore,</i> 258 Neb. 199, 206, 602 N. W. 2d 465, 472 (1995). Thus the court denied each branch of Nebraska's government any role in the interpretation or enforcement of the statute. This cannot be what <i>Casey</i> meant when it said we would be more solicitous of state attempts to vindicate interests related to abortion. <i>Casey</i> did not assume this state of affairs.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>Ignoring substantial medical and ethical opinion, the Court substitutes its own judgment for the judgment of Nebraska and some 30 other States and sweeps the law away. The Court's holding stems from misunderstanding the record, misinterpretation of <i>Casey,</i> outright refusal to respect the law of a State, and statutory construction in conflict with settled rules. The decision nullifies a law expressing the will of the people of Nebraska that medical procedures must be governed by moral principles having their foundation in the intrinsic value of human life, including the life of the unborn. Through their law the people of Nebraska were forthright in confronting an issue of immense moral consequence. The State chose to forbid a procedure many decent and civilized people find so abhorrent as to be among the most serious of crimes against human life, while the State still protected the woman's autonomous right of choice as reaffirmed in <i>Casey.</i> The Court closes its eyes to these profound concerns.</p>\\\\n<p>From the decision, the reasoning, and the judgment, I dissent.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*980</span> Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenting.</p>\\\\n<p>In 1973, this Court struck down an Act of the Texas Legislature that had been in effect since 1857, thereby rendering unconstitutional abortion statutes in dozens of States. <i>Roe</i>  v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 119. As some of my colleagues on the Court, past and present, ably demonstrated, that decision was grievously wrong. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 221-223 (1973) (White, J., dissenting); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 171-178 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or potential human life. Nothing in our Federal Constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to determine whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a State <i>may</i> permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State <i>must</i> do so.</p>\\\\n<p>In the years following <i>Roe,</i> this Court applied, and, worse, extended, that decision to strike down numerous state statutes that purportedly threatened a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. The Court voided parental consent laws, see <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 75 (1976), legislation requiring that second-trimester abortions take place in hospitals, see <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 431 (1983), and even a requirement that both parents of a minor be notified before their child has an abortion, see <i>Hodgson</i> v. <i>Minnesota,</i>  497 U. S. 417, 455 (1990). It was only a slight exaggeration when this Court described, in 1976, a right to abortion \\\\\\\"without interference from the State.\\\\\\\" <i>Danforth, supra,</i> at 61. The Court's expansive application of <i>Roe</i> in this period, even more than <i>Roe</i> itself, was fairly described as the \\\\\\\"unrestrained imposition of [the Court's] own, extra constitutional value preferences\\\\\\\" on the American people. <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*981</span> <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 794 (1986) (White, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>It appeared that this era of Court-mandated abortion on demand had come to an end, first with our decision in <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Reproductive Health Services,</i> 492 U. S. 490 (1989), see <i>id.,</i> at 557 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (lamenting that the plurality had \\\\\\\"discard[ed]\\\\\\\" <i>Roe</i> ), and then finally (or so we were told) in our decision in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Although in <i>Casey</i> the separate opinions of The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia urging the Court to overrule <i>Roe</i> did not command a majority, seven Members of that Court, including six Members sitting today, acknowledged that States have a legitimate role in regulating abortion and recognized the States' interest in respecting fetal life at all stages of development. See 505 U. S., at 877 (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 944 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 979 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Thomas, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The plurality authored by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter concluded that prior case law \\\\\\\"went too far\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"undervalu[ing] the State's interest in potential life\\\\\\\" and in \\\\\\\"striking down . . . some abortion regulations which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 875.<sup>[1]</sup><i>Roe</i> and subsequent cases, according to the plurality, had wrongly \\\\\\\"treat[ed] all governmental attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of the potential life within her as unwarranted,\\\\\\\" a treatment that was \\\\\\\"incompatible with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 876. Accordingly, the plurality held that so <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*982</span> long as state regulation of abortion furthers legitimate interests\\u00c2\\u2014that is, interests not designed to strike at the right itself\\u00c2\\u2014the regulation is invalid only if it imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion, meaning that it places a <i>substantial obstacle</i> in the woman's path. <i>Id.,</i> at 874, 877.</p>\\\\n<p>My views on the merits of the <i>Casey</i> plurality have been fully articulated by others. <i>Id.,</i> at 944 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i>  at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). I will not restate those views here, except to note that the <i>Casey</i> plurality opinion was constructed by its authors out of whole cloth. The standard set forth in the <i>Casey</i> plurality has no historical or doctrinal pedigree. The standard is a product of its authors' own philosophical views about abortion, and it should go without saying that it has no origins in or relationship to the Constitution and is, consequently, as illegitimate as the standard it purported to replace. Even assuming, however, as I will for the remainder of this dissent, that <i>Casey</i>`s fabricated undue-burden standard merits adherence (which it does not), today's decision is extraordinary. Today, the Court inexplicably holds that the States cannot constitutionally prohibit a method of abortion that millions find hard to distinguish from infanticide and that the Court hesitates even to describe. <i>Ante,</i> at 923. This holding cannot be reconciled with <i>Casey</i>`s undue-burden standard, as that standard was explained to us by the authors of the plurality opinion, and the majority hardly pretends otherwise. In striking down this statute\\u00c2\\u2014which expresses a profound and legitimate respect for fetal life and which leaves unimpeded several other safe forms of abortion\\u00c2\\u2014the majority opinion gives the lie to the promise of <i>Casey</i> that regulations that do no more than \\\\\\\"express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose\\\\\\\" whether or not to have an abortion. 505 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*983</span> U. S., at 877. Today's decision is so obviously irreconcilable with <i>Casey</i>`s explication of what its undue-burden standard requires, let alone the Constitution, that it should be seen for what it is, a reinstitution of the pre-<i>Webster</i> abortion-ondemand era in which the mere invocation of \\\\\\\"abortion rights\\\\\\\" trumps any contrary societal interest. If this statute is unconstitutional under <i>Casey,</i> then <i>Casey</i> meant nothing at all, and the Court should candidly admit it.</p>\\\\n<p>To reach its decision, the majority must take a series of indefensible steps. The majority must first disregard the principles that this Court follows in every context but abortion: We interpret statutes according to their plain meaning, and we do not strike down statutes susceptible of a narrowing construction. The majority also must disregard the very constitutional standard it purports to employ, and then displace the considered judgment of the people of Nebraska and 29 other States. The majority's decision is lamentable, because of the result the majority reaches, the illogical steps the majority takes to reach it, and because it portends a return to an era I had thought we had at last abandoned.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>In the almost 30 years since <i>Roe,</i> this Court has never described the various methods of aborting a second- or third-trimester fetus. From reading the majority's sanitized description, one would think that this case involves state regulation of a widely accepted routine medical procedure. Nothing could be further from the truth. The most widely used method of abortion during this stage of pregnancy is so gruesome that its use can be traumatic even for the physicians and medical staff who perform it. See App. 656 (testimony of Dr. Boehm); W. Hern, Abortion Practice 134 (1990). And the particular procedure at issue in this case, \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" so closely borders on infanticide that 30 States have attempted to ban it. I will begin with a discussion of the methods of abortion available to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*984</span> women late in their pregnancies before addressing the statutory and constitutional questions involved.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>1. The primary form of abortion used at or after 16 weeks' gestation is known as \\\\\\\"dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"D&amp;E.\\\\\\\" 11 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1103, 1129 (Neb. 1998). When performed during that stage of pregnancy, the D&amp;E procedure requires the physician to dilate the woman's cervix and then extract the fetus from her uterus with forceps. <i>Id.,</i> at 1103; App. 490 (American Medical Association (AMA), Report of the Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion). Because of the fetus' size at this stage, the physician generally removes the fetus by dismembering the fetus one piece at a time.<sup>[3]</sup> 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1103-1104. The doctor grabs a fetal extremity, such as an arm or a leg, with forceps and \\\\\\\"pulls it through the cervical so . . .tearing . . . fetal parts from the fetal body . . . by means of traction.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1104. See App. 55 (testimony of Dr. Carhart). In other words, the physician will grasp the fetal parts and \\\\\\\"basically tear off pieces of the fetus and pull them out.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 267 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). See also <i>id.,</i> at 149 (testimony of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*985</span> Dr. Hodgson) (\\\\\\\"[Y]ou grasp the fetal parts, and you often don't know what they are, and you try to pull it down, and its . . . simply all there is to it\\\\\\\"). The fetus will die from blood loss, either because the physician has separated the umbilical cord prior to beginning the procedure or because the fetus loses blood as its limbs are removed. <i>Id.,</i> at 62\\u00c2\\u2014 64 (testimony of Dr. Carhart); <i>id.,</i> at 151 (testimony of Dr. Hodgson).<sup>[4]</sup> When all of the fetus' limbs have been removed and only the head is left in utero, the physician will then collapse the skull and pull it through the cervical canal. <i>Id.,</i> at 106 (testimony of Dr. Carhart); <i>id.,</i> at 297 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield); <i>Causeway Medical Suite</i> v. <i>Foster,</i> 43 F. Supp. 2d 604, 608 (ED La. 1999). At the end of the procedure, the physician is left, in respondent's words, with a \\\\\\\"tray full of pieces.\\\\\\\" App. 125 (testimony of Dr. Carhart).</p>\\\\n<p>2. Some abortions after the 15th week are performed using a method of abortion known as induction. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108; App. 492 (AMA, Report of the Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion). In an induction procedure, the amniotic sac is injected with an abortifacient such as a saline solution or a solution that contains prostag land in. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1108. Uterine contractions typically follow, causing the fetus to be expelled. <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>3. A third form of abortion for use during or after 16 weeks' gestation is referred to by some medical professionals as \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E.\\\\\\\" There are two variations of this method, both of which require the physician to dilate the woman's cervix. Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery 1043 (D. Nichols &amp; D. Clarke-Pearson eds., 2d ed. 2000); App. 271 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). The first variation is used only in vertex presentations, that is, when the fetal head is presented first. To perform a vertex-presentation intact D&amp;E, the doctor will insert an instrument into the fetus' <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*986</span> skull while the fetus is still in utero and remove the brain and other intracranial contents. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1111; Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, <i>supra,</i> at 1043; App. 271 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). When the fetal skull collapses, the physician will remove the fetus.</p>\\\\n<p>The second variation of intact D&amp;E is the procedure commonly known as \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion.\\\\\\\"<sup>[5]</sup> 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106; Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, <i>supra,</i>  at 1043; App. 271 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield). This procedure, which is used only rarely, is performed on mid- to late-second-trimester (and sometimes third-trimester) fetuses.<sup>[6]</sup> Although there are variations, it is generally performed <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*987</span> as follows: After dilating the cervix, the physician will grab the fetus by its feet and pull the fetal body out of the uterus into the vaginal cavity. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106. At this stage of development, the head is the largest part of the body. Assuming the physician has performed the dilation procedure correctly, the head will be held inside the uterus by the woman's cervix. <i>Ibid.;</i> H. R. 1833 Hearing 8. While the fetus is stuck in this position, dangling partly out of the woman's body, and just a few inches from a completed birth, the physician uses an instrument such as a pair of scissors to tear or perforate the skull. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106; App. 664 (testimony of Dr. Boehm); Joint Hearing on S. 6 and H. R. 929 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., 45 (1995) (hereinafter S. 6 and H. R. 929 Joint Hearing). The physician will then either crush the skull or will use a vacuum to remove the brain and other intracranial contents from the fetal skull, collapse the fetus' head, and pull the fetus from the uterus. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Use of the partial birth abortion procedure achieved prominence as a national issue after it was publicly described by Dr. Martin Haskell, in a paper entitled \\\\\\\"Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester Abortion,\\\\\\\" at the National Abortion Federation's September 1992 Risk Management Seminar. In that paper, Dr. Haskell described his version of the procedure as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"With a lower [fetal] extremity in the vagina, the surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the opposite lower <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*988</span> extremity, then the torso, the shoulders and the upper extremities.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The skull lodges at the internal cervical so. Usually there is not enough dilation for it to pass through. The fetus is oriented dorsum or spine up.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"At this point, the right-handed surgeon slides the fingers of the left hand along the back of the fetus and `hooks' the shoulders of the fetus with the index and ring fingers (palm down).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[T]he surgeon takes a pair of blunt curved Metzenbaum scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip, curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger until he feels it contact the base of the skull under the tip of his middle finger.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[T]he surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the skull or into the foramen magnum. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the scissors to enlarge the opening.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents. With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the fetus, removing it completely from the patient.\\\\\\\" H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 8-9.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>In cases in which the physician inadvertently dilates the woman to too great a degree, the physician will have to hold the fetus inside the woman so that he can perform the procedure. <i>Id.,</i> at 80 (statement of Pamela Smith, M. D.) (\\\\\\\"In these procedures, one basically relies on cervical entrapment of the head, along with a firm grip, to help keep the baby in place while the practitioner plunges a pair of scissors into the base of the baby's skull\\\\\\\"). See also S. 6 and H. R. 929 Joint Hearing 45 (\\\\\\\"I could put dilapan in for four or five days and say I'm doing a D&amp;E procedure and the fetus could just fall out. But that's not really the point. The point here is you're attempting to do an abortion . . . . Not to see how do <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*989</span> I manipulate the situation so that I get a live birth instead\\\\\\\") (quoting Dr. Haskell).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Nebraska, along with 29 other States, has attempted to ban the partial birth abortion procedure. Although the Nebraska statute purports to prohibit only \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" a phrase which is commonly used, as I mentioned, to refer to the breech extraction version of intact D&amp;E, the majority concludes that this statute could also be read in some future case to prohibit ordinary D&amp;E, the first procedure described above. According to the majority, such an application would pose a substantial obstacle to some women seeking abortions and, therefore, the statute is unconstitutional. The majority errs with its very first step. I think it is clear that the Nebraska statute does not prohibit the D&amp;E procedure. The Nebraska partial birth abortion statute at issue in this case reads as follows:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"No partial-birth abortion shall be performed in this state, unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.\\\\\\\" Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1) (Supp. 1999).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is defined in the statute as \\\\\\\"an abortion procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and completing the delivery. For purposes of this subdivision, the term partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child means deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*990</span> procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Starting with the statutory definition of \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" I think it highly doubtful that the statute could be applied to ordinary D&amp;E. First, the Nebraska statute applies only if the physician \\\\\\\"partially <i>delivers</i> vaginally a living unborn child,\\\\\\\" which phrase is defined to mean \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally <i>delivering</i> into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) (emphases added). When read in context, the term \\\\\\\"partially delivers\\\\\\\" cannot be fairly interpreted to include removing pieces of an unborn child from the uterus one at a time.</p>\\\\n<p>The word \\\\\\\"deliver,\\\\\\\" particularly delivery of an \\\\\\\"unborn child,\\\\\\\" refers to the process of \\\\\\\"assist[ing] in giving birth,\\\\\\\" which suggests removing an intact unborn child from the womb, rather than pieces of a child. See Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 336 (1991) (defining \\\\\\\"deliver\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"to assist in giving birth; to aid in the birth of\\\\\\\"); Stedman's Medical Dictionary 409 (26th ed. 1995) (\\\\\\\"To assist a woman in childbirth\\\\\\\"). Without question, one does not \\\\\\\"deliver\\\\\\\" a child when one removes the child from the uterus piece by piece, as in a D&amp;E. Rather, in the words of respondent and his experts, one \\\\\\\"remove[s]\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"dismember[s]\\\\\\\" the child in a D&amp;E. App. 45, 55 (testimony of Dr. Carhart) (referring to the act of removing the fetus in a D&amp;E); <i>id.,</i> at 150 (testimony of Dr. Hodgson) (same); <i>id.,</i> at 267 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield) (physician \\\\\\\"dismember[s]\\\\\\\" the fetus). See also H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 8 (Dr. Haskell describing \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" of part of the fetus during a D&amp;X). The majority cites sources using the terms \\\\\\\"deliver\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" to refer to removal of the fetus and the placenta during birth. But these sources also presume an intact fetus, rather than dismembered fetal parts. See Obstetrics: Normal &amp; Problem Pregnancies 388 (S. Gabbe, J. Niebyl, &amp; J. Simpson eds., 3d <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*991</span> ed. 1996) (\\\\\\\"After delivery [of infant and placenta], the placenta, cord, and membranes should be examined\\\\\\\"); 4 Oxford English Dictionary 421, 422 (2d ed. 1989) (\\\\\\\"To disburden (a woman) of the foetus, to bring to childbirth\\\\\\\"); B. Maloy, Medical Dictionary for Lawyers 221 (2d ed. 1989) (\\\\\\\"To aid in the process of childbirth; to bring forth; to deliver the fetus, placenta\\\\\\\"). The majority has pointed to no source in which \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" is used to refer to removal of first a fetal arm, then a leg, then the torso, etc. In fact, even the majority describes the D&amp;E procedure without using the word \\\\\\\"deliver\\\\\\\" to refer to the removal of fetal tissue from the uterus. See <i>ante,</i> at 939 (\\\\\\\"<i>pulling</i> a `substantial portion' of a still living fetus\\\\\\\" (emphasis added)); <i>ibid.</i> (\\\\\\\"portion of a living fetus has been <i>pulled</i> into the vagina\\\\\\\" (emphasis added)). No one, including the majority, understands the act of pulling off a part of a fetus to be a \\\\\\\"delivery.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>To make the statute's meaning even more clear, the statute applies only if the physician \\\\\\\"partially delivers vaginally a living unborn child <i>before</i> killing the unborn child and completing the delivery.\\\\\\\" The statute defines this phrase to mean that the physician must complete the delivery \\\\\\\"<i>for the purpose of</i> performing a procedure\\\\\\\" that will kill the unborn child. It is clear from these phrases that the procedure that kills the fetus must be subsequent to, and therefore separate from, the \\\\\\\"partia[l] deliver[y]\\\\\\\" or the \\\\\\\"deliver[y] into the vagina\\\\\\\" of \\\\\\\"a living unborn child or substantial portion thereof.\\\\\\\" In other words, even if one assumes, <i>arguendo,</i>  that dismemberment\\u00c2\\u2014the act of grasping a fetal arm or leg and pulling until it comes off, leaving the remaining part of the fetal body still in the uterus\\u00c2\\u2014is a kind of \\\\\\\"delivery,\\\\\\\" it does not take place \\\\\\\"before\\\\\\\" the death-causing procedure or \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing\\\\\\\" the death-causing procedure; it <i>is</i> the death-causing procedure. Under the majority's view, D&amp;E is covered by the statute because when the doctor pulls on a fetal foot until it tears off he has \\\\\\\"delivered\\\\\\\" a substantial portion of the unborn child and has performed <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*992</span> a procedure known to cause death. But, significantly, the physician has not \\\\\\\"delivered\\\\\\\" the child <i>before</i> performing the death-causing procedure or \\\\\\\"for the purpose of\\\\\\\" performing the death-causing procedure; the dismemberment \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\" is itself the act that causes the fetus' death.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, even if removal of a fetal foot or arm from the uterus incidental to severing it from the rest of the fetal body could amount to delivery <i>before,</i> or <i>for the purpose of,</i>  performing a death-causing procedure, the delivery would not be of an \\\\\\\"unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof.\\\\\\\" And even supposing that a fetal foot or arm could conceivably be a \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" of an unborn child, both the common understanding of \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" and the principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties would require one to read \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" otherwise. See <i>infra,</i> at 996-997.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Although I think that the text of \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326(9) forecloses any application of the Nebraska statute to the D&amp;E procedure, even if there were any ambiguity, the ambiguity would be conclusively resolved by reading the definition in light of the fact that the Nebraska statute, by its own terms, applies only to \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-328(1). By ordinary rules of statutory interpretation, we should resolve any ambiguity in the specific statutory definition to comport with the common understanding of \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" for that term itself, no less than the specific definition, is part of the statute. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*993</span> <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton,</i> 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984) (\\\\\\\"We do not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole\\\\\\\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is a term that has been used by a majority of state legislatures, the United States Congress, medical journals, physicians, reporters, even judges, and has never, as far as I am aware, been used to refer to the D&amp;E procedure. The number of instances in which \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" has been equated with the breech extraction form of intact D&amp;E (otherwise known as \\\\\\\"D&amp;X\\\\\\\")<sup>[10]</sup> and explicitly contrasted with D&amp;E, are numerous. I will limit myself to just a few examples.</p>\\\\n<p>First, numerous medical authorities have equated \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" with D&amp;X. The AMA has done so and has recognized that the procedure is \\\\\\\"different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus . . . is killed <i>outside</i> of the womb.\\\\\\\" AMA Board of Trustees Factsheet on H. R. 1122 (June 1997), in App. to Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1. Medical literature has also equated \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" with D&amp;X as distinguished from D&amp;E. See Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery, at 1043; Sprang &amp; Neerhof, Rationale for Banning Abortions Late in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998); Bopp &amp; Cook, Partial Birth Abortion: The Final Frontier of Abortion Jurisprudence, 14 Issues in Law and Medicine 3 (1998). Physicians have equated \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" with D&amp;X. See <i>Planned Parenthood</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 44 F. Supp. 2d 975, 999 (WD Wis. 1999) (citing testimony); <i>Richmond Medical Center for Women</i> v. <i>Gil-</i>  <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*994</span> <i>more,</i> 55 F. Supp. 2d 441, 455 (ED Va. 1999) (citing testimony). Even respondent's expert, Dr. Phillip Stubblefield, acknowledged that breech extraction intact D&amp;E is referred to in the lay press as \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion.\\\\\\\" App. 271.</p>\\\\n<p>Second, the lower courts have repeatedly acknowledged that \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is commonly understood to mean D&amp;X. See <i>Little Rock Family Planning Services</i> v. <i>Jegley,</i> 192 F. 3d 794, 795 (CA8 1999) (\\\\\\\"The term `partialbirth abortion,' . . . is commonly understood to refer to a particular procedure also known as intact dilation and extraction\\\\\\\"); <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa, Inc.</i> v. <i>Miller,</i> 195 F. 3d 386, 387 (CA8 1999) (\\\\\\\"The [Iowa] Act prohibits `partial-birth abortion,' a term commonly understood to refer to a procedure called a dilation and extraction (D&amp;X)\\\\\\\"). The District Court in this case noted that \\\\\\\"[p]artial-birth abortions\\\\\\\" are \\\\\\\"known medically as intact dilation and extraction or D&amp;X.\\\\\\\" 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1121, n. 26. Even the majority notes that \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is a term \\\\\\\"ordinarily associated with the D&amp;X procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 942.</p>\\\\n<p>Third, the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" has been used in state legislation on 28 occasions and by Congress twice. The term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" was adopted by Congress in both 1995 and 1997 in two separate pieces of legislation prohibiting the procedure.<sup>[11]</sup> In considering the legislation, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*995</span> Congress conducted numerous hearings and debates on the issue, which repeatedly described \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" as a procedure distinct from D&amp;E. The Congressional Record contained numerous references to Dr. Haskell's procedure. See, <i>e. g.,</i> H. R. 1833 Hearing 3, 17, 52, 77; S. 6 and H. R. 929 Joint Hearing 45. Since that time, debates have taken place in state legislatures across the country, 30 of which have voted to prohibit the procedure. With only two exceptions, the legislatures that voted to ban the procedure referred to it as \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion.\\\\\\\"<sup>[12]</sup> These debates also referred to Dr. Haskell's procedure as D&amp;X. Both the evidence before the legislators and the legislators themselves equated \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" with D&amp;X. The fact that 28 States adopted legislation banning \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" defined it in a way similar or identical to Nebraska's definition,<sup>[13]</sup> and, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*996</span> in doing so, repeatedly referred to the breech extraction form of intact D&amp;E and repeatedly distinguished it from ordinary D&amp;E, makes it inconceivable that the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" could reasonably be interpreted to mean D&amp;E.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Were there any doubt remaining whether the statute could apply to a D&amp;E procedure, that doubt is no ground for invalidating the statute. Rather, we are bound to first consider whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible that would avoid the constitutional question. <i>Erznoznik</i> v. <i>Jacksonville,</i> 422 U. S. 205, 216 (1975) (\\\\\\\"[A] state statute should not be deemed facially invalid unless it is not readily subject to a narrowing construction by the state courts\\\\\\\"); <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988) (\\\\\\\"The precise scope of the ban is not further described within the text of the ordinance, but in our view the ordinance is readily subject to a narrowing construction that avoids constitutional difficulties\\\\\\\"). This principle is, as Justice O'Connor has said, so \\\\\\\"wellestablished\\\\\\\" that failure to apply is \\\\\\\"plain error.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 483. Although our interpretation of a Nebraska law is of course not binding on Nebraska courts, it is clear, as <i>Erznoznik</i> and <i>Frisby</i> demonstrate, that, absent a conflicting interpretation by Nebraska (and there is none here), we should, if the text permits, adopt such a construction.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*997</span> The majority contends that application of the Nebraska statute to D&amp;E would pose constitutional difficulties because it would eliminate the most common form of secondtrimester abortions. To the extent that the majority's contention is true, there is no doubt that the Nebraska statute is susceptible of a narrowing construction by Nebraska courts that would preserve a physicians' ability to perform D&amp;E. See <i>State</i> v. <i>Carpenter,</i> 250 Neb. 427, 434, 551 N. W. 2d 518, 524 (1996) (\\\\\\\"A penal statute must be construed so as to meet constitutional requirements if such can reasonably be done\\\\\\\"). For example, the statute requires that the physician \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delive[r] into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof,\\\\\\\" before performing a death-causing procedure. The term \\\\\\\"substantial portion\\\\\\\" is susceptible to a narrowing construction that would exclude the D&amp;E procedure. One definition of the word \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\"being largely but not wholly that which is specified.\\\\\\\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, at 1176. See <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Underwood,</i> 487 U. S. 552, 564 (1988) (describing different meanings of the term \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\"). In other words, \\\\\\\"substantial\\\\\\\" can mean \\\\\\\"almost all\\\\\\\" of the thing denominated. If nothing else, a court could construe the statute to require that the fetus be \\\\\\\"largely, but not wholly,\\\\\\\" delivered out of the uterus before the physician performs a procedure that he knows will kill the unborn child. Or, as I have discussed, a court could (and should) construe \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing a procedure\\\\\\\" to mean \\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing a separate procedure.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>The majority and Justice O'Connor reject the plain language of the statutory definition, refuse to read that definition in light of the statutory reference to \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" and ignore the doctrine of constitutional avoidance. In so doing, they offer scant statutory analysis of their own. See <i>ante,</i> at 938-940 (majority opinion); cf. <i>ante,</i> at 940-945 <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*998</span> (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 948-949 (O'Connor, J., concurring). In their brief analyses, the majority and Justice O'Connor disregard all of the statutory language except for the final definitional sentence, thereby violating the fundamental canon of construction that statutes are to be read as a whole. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Morton,</i> 467 U. S., at 828 (\\\\\\\"We do not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole. Thus, the words [in question] must be read in light of the immediately following phrase\\\\\\\") (footnote omitted)); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Heirs of Boisdor\\u00c3\\u00a9,</i> 8 How. 113, 122 (1849) (\\\\\\\"In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy\\\\\\\"); <i>Gustafson</i> v. <i>Alloyd Co.,</i> 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995) (\\\\\\\"[A] word is known by the company it keeps\\\\\\\").<sup>[14]</sup> In lieu of analyzing the statute as a whole, the majority and Justice O'Connor <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*999</span> offer five principal arguments for their interpretation of the statute. I will address them in turn.</p>\\\\n<p>First, the majority appears to accept, if only obliquely, an argument made by respondent: If the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" refers to only the breech extraction form of intact D&amp;E, or D&amp;X, the Nebraska Legislature should have used the medical nomenclature. See <i>ante,</i> at 943 (noting that the Nebraska Legislature rejected an amendment that would replace \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction\\\\\\\"); Brief for Respondent 4-5, 24.</p>\\\\n<p>There is, of course, no requirement that a legislature use terminology accepted by the medical community. A legislature could, no doubt, draft a statute using the term \\\\\\\"heart attack\\\\\\\" even if the medical community preferred \\\\\\\"myocardial infarction.\\\\\\\" Legislatures, in fact, sometimes use medical terms in ways that conflict with their clinical definitions, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Barber</i> v. <i>Director,</i> 43 F. 3d 899, 901 (CA4 1995) (noting that the medical definition of \\\\\\\"pneumoconiosis\\\\\\\" is only a subset of the afflictions that fall within the definition of \\\\\\\"pneumoconiosis\\\\\\\" in the Black Lung Act), a practice that is unremarkable so long as the legal term is adequately defined. We have never, until today, suggested that legislature may only use words accepted by every individual physician. Rather, \\\\\\\"we have traditionally left to legislators the task of defining terms of a medical nature that have legal significance.\\\\\\\" <i>Kansas</i> v. <i>Hendricks,</i> 521 U. S. 346, 359 (1997). And we have noted that \\\\\\\"[o]ften, those definitions do not fit precisely with the definitions employed by the medical community.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> </p>\\\\n<p>Further, it is simply not true that the many legislatures, including Nebraska's, that prohibited \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" chose to use a term known only in the vernacular in place of a term with an accepted clinical meaning. When the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995 was introduced in Congress, the term \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" did not appear in any medical dictionary. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Dorland's Illustrated <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1000</span> Medical Dictionary 470 (28th ed. 1994); Stedman's Medical Dictionary, at 485; Miller-Keane Encyclopedia &amp; Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, &amp; Allied Health 460 (6th ed. 1997); The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary 204 (1987); I. Dox, J. Melloni, &amp; G. Eisher, The Harper Collins Illustrated Medical Dictionary 131 (1993). The term did not appear in descriptions of abortion methods in leading medical textbooks. See, <i>e. g.,</i> G. Cunningham et al., Williams Obstetrics 579-605 (20th ed. 1997); Obstetrics: Normal &amp; Problem Pregnancies, at 1249-1279; W. Hern, Abortion Practice (1990). Abortion reference books also omitted any reference to the term. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Modern Methods of Inducing Abortion (D. Baird, D. Grimes, &amp; P. Van Look eds. 1995); E. Glick, Surgical Abortion (1998).<sup>[15]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Not only did D&amp;X have no medical meaning at the time, but the term is ambiguous on its face. \\\\\\\"Dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" would, on its face, accurately describe any procedure in which the woman is \\\\\\\"dilated\\\\\\\" and the fetus \\\\\\\"extracted,\\\\\\\" including D&amp;E. See <i>supra,</i> at 984-985. In contrast, \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" has the advantage of faithfully describing the procedure the legislature meant to address because the fact that a fetus is \\\\\\\"partially born\\\\\\\" during the procedure is indisputable. The term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is completely accurate and descriptive, which is perhaps the reason why the majority finds it objectionable. Only a desire to find fault at any cost could explain the Court's willingness to penalize the Nebraska Legislature for failing to replace a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1001</span> descriptive term with a vague one. There is, therefore, nothing to the majority's argument that the Nebraska Legislature is at fault for declining to use the term \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction.\\\\\\\"<sup>[16]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Second, the majority faults the Nebraska Legislature for failing to \\\\\\\"track the medical differences between D&amp;E and D&amp;X\\\\\\\" and for failing to \\\\\\\"suggest that its application turns on whether a portion of the fetus' body is drawn into the vagina as part of a process to extract an intact fetus after collapsing the head as opposed to a process that would dismember the fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 939. I have already explained why the Nebraska statute reflects the medical differences between D&amp;X and D&amp;E. To the extent the majority means that the Nebraska Legislature should have \\\\\\\"tracked the medical differences\\\\\\\" by adopting one of the informal definitions of D&amp;X, this argument is without merit; none of these definitions would have been effective to accomplish the State's purpose of preventing abortions of partially born fetuses. Take, for example, ACOG's informal definition of the term \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;X.\\\\\\\" According to ACOG, an \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;X\\\\\\\" consists of the following four steps: (1) deliberate dilation of <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1002</span> the cervix, usually over a sequence of days; (2) instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling breach; (3) breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and (4) partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus. App. 599-600 (ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997)). ACOG emphasizes that \\\\\\\"unless all four elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an intact D&amp;X.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 600. Had Nebraska adopted a statute prohibiting \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;X,\\\\\\\" and defined it along the lines of the ACOG definition, physicians attempting to perform abortions on partially born fetuses could have easily evaded the statute. Any doctor wishing to perform a partial birth abortion procedure could simply avoid liability under such a statute by performing the procedure, as respondent does, only when the fetus is presented feet first, thereby avoiding the necessity of \\\\\\\"conversion of the fetus to a footling breech.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 599. Or, a doctor could convert the fetus without instruments. Or, the doctor could cause the fetus' death before \\\\\\\"partial evacuation of the intracranial contents,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 600, by plunging scissors into the fetus' heart, for example. A doctor could even attempt to evade the statute by chopping off two fetal toes prior to completing delivery, preventing the State from arguing that the fetus was \\\\\\\"otherwise intact.\\\\\\\" Presumably, however, Nebraska, and the many other legislative bodies that adopted partial birth abortion bans, were not concerned with whether death was inflicted by injury to the brain or the heart, whether the fetus was converted with or without instruments, or whether the fetus died with its toes attached. These legislative bodies were, I presume, concerned with whether the child was partially born before the physician caused its death. The legislatures' evident concern was with permitting a procedure that resembles infanticide and threatens to dehumanize the fetus. They, therefore, presumably declined to adopt a <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1003</span> ban only on \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;X,\\\\\\\" as defined by ACOG, because it would have been ineffective to that purpose. Again, the majority is faulting Nebraska for a legitimate legislative calculation.</p>\\\\n<p>Third, the majority and Justice O'Connor argue that this Court generally defers to lower federal courts' interpretations of state law. <i>Ante,</i> at 940 (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i>  at 949 (O'Connor, J., concurring). However, a decision drafted by Justice O'Connor, which she inexplicably fails to discuss, <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474 (1988), makes clear why deference is inappropriate here. As Justice O'Connor explained in that case:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[W]hile we ordinarily defer to lower court constructions of state statutes, we do not invariably do so. We are particularly reluctant to defer when the lower courts have fallen into plain error, which is precisely the situation presented here. To the extent they endorsed a broad reading of the ordinance, the lower courts ran afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i>  at 483 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p><i>Frisby,</i> then, identifies exactly why the lower courts' opinions here are not entitled to deference: The lower courts failed to identify the narrower construction that, consistent with the text, would avoid any constitutional difficulties.</p>\\\\n<p>Fourth, the majority speculates that some Nebraska prosecutor may attempt to stretch the statute to apply it to D&amp;E. But a state statute is not unconstitutional on its face merely because we can imagine an aggressive prosecutor who would attempt an overly aggressive application of the statute. We have noted that \\\\\\\"`[w]ords inevitably contain germs of uncertainty.' \\\\\\\" <i>Broadrick</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 413 U. S. 601, 608 (1973). We do not give statutes the broadest definition imaginable. Rather, we ask whether \\\\\\\"the ordinary <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1004</span> person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with [the statute].\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid. (</i> quoting <i>Civil Service Comm'n</i> v. <i>Letter Carriers,</i> 413 U. S. 548, 579 (1973)). While a creative legal mind might be able to stretch the plain language of the Nebraska statute to apply to D&amp;E, \\\\\\\"citizens who desire to obey the statute will have no difficulty in understanding it.\\\\\\\" <i>Colten</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, the majority discusses at some length the reasons it will not defer to the interpretation of the statute proffered by the Nebraska Attorney General, despite the Attorney General's repeated representations to this Court that his State will not apply the partial birth abortion statute to D&amp;E. See Brief for Petitioners 11-13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\\u00c2\\u2014 11. The fact that the Court declines to defer to the interpretation of the Attorney General is not, however, a reason to give the statute a contrary representation. Even without according the Attorney General's view any particular respect, we should agree with his interpretation because it is undoubtedly the correct one. Moreover, Justice O'Connor has noted that the Court should adopt a narrow interpretation of a state statute when it is supported by the principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties as well as by \\\\\\\"the representations of counsel . . . at oral argument.\\\\\\\" <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz, supra,</i> at 483. Such an approach is particularly appropriate in this case because, as the majority notes, Nebraska courts accord the Nebraska Attorney General's interpretations of state statutes \\\\\\\"substantial weight.\\\\\\\" See <i>State</i> v. <i>Coffman,</i> 213 Neb. 560, 561, 330 N. W. 2d 727, 728 (1983). Therefore, any renegade prosecutor bringing criminal charges against a physician for performing a D&amp;E would find himself confronted with a contrary interpretation of the statute by the Nebraska Attorney General, and, I assume, a judge who both possessed common <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1005</span> sense and was aware of the rule of lenity. See <i>State</i> v. <i>White,</i> 254 Neb. 566, 575, 577 N. W. 2d 741, 747 (1998).<sup>[17]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>IV</h2>\\\\n<p>Having resolved that Nebraska's partial birth abortion statute permits doctors to perform D&amp;E abortions, the question remains whether a State can constitutionally prohibit the partial birth abortion procedure without a health exception. Although the majority and Justice O'Connor purport to rely on the standard articulated in the <i>Casey</i> plurality in concluding that a State may not, they in fact disregard it entirely.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>Though Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter declined in <i>Casey,</i> on the ground of <i>stare decisis,</i> to reconsider whether abortion enjoys any constitutional protection, 505 U. S., at 844-846, 854-869 (majority opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 871 (plurality opinion), <i>Casey</i> professed to be, in part, a repudiation of <i>Roe</i> and its progeny. The <i>Casey</i> plurality expressly noted that prior case law had undervalued the State's interest in potential life, 505 U. S., at 875-876, and had invalidated regulations of abortion that \\\\\\\"in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 875. See <i>id.,</i> at 871 (\\\\\\\"<i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> speaks with clarity in establishing . . . the State's `important and legitimate interest in potential life.' That portion <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1006</span> of the decision in <i>Roe</i> has been given too little acknowledgment\\\\\\\" (citation omitted)). The plurality repeatedly recognized the States' weighty interest in this area. See <i>id.,</i> at 877 (\\\\\\\"State . . . may express profound respect for the life of the unborn\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 878 (\\\\\\\"the State's profound interest in potential life\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 850 (majority opinion) (\\\\\\\"profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage\\\\\\\"). And, the plurality expressed repeatedly the States' legitimate role in regulating abortion procedures. See <i>id.,</i> at 876 (\\\\\\\"The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 875 (\\\\\\\"Not all governmental intrusion [with abortion] is of necessity unwarranted\\\\\\\"). According to the plurality: \\\\\\\"The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 874.</p>\\\\n<p>The <i>Casey</i> plurality therefore adopted the standard: \\\\\\\"Only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> A regulation imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" only if it \\\\\\\"has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 877.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>There is no question that the State of Nebraska has a valid interest\\u00c2\\u2014one not designed to strike at the right itself\\u00c2\\u2014in prohibiting partial birth abortion. <i>Casey</i> itself noted that States may \\\\\\\"express profound respect for the life of the unborn.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> States may, without a doubt, express this profound respect by prohibiting a procedure that approaches infanticide, and thereby dehumanizes the fetus and trivializes human life. The AMA has recognized that this procedure is \\\\\\\"ethically different from other destructive abortion <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1007</span> techniques because the fetus, normally twenty weeks or longer in gestation, is killed <i>outside</i> the womb. The `partial birth' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body.\\\\\\\" AMA Board of Trustees Factsheet on H. R. 1122 (June 1997), in App. to Brief for Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 1. Thirty States have concurred with this view.</p>\\\\n<p>Although the description of this procedure set forth above should be sufficient to demonstrate the resemblance between the partial birth abortion procedure and infanticide, the testimony of one nurse who observed a partial birth abortion procedure makes the point even more vividly:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall.</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a highpowered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp.\\\\\\\" H. R. 1833 Hearing 18 (statement of Brenda Pratt Shafer).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The question whether States have a legitimate interest in banning the procedure does not require additional authority. See <i>ante,</i> at 961-964 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).<sup>[18]</sup> In a civilized <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1008</span> society, the answer is too obvious, and the contrary arguments too offensive, to merit further discussion. But see <i>ante,</i> at 946-947 (Stevens, J., concurring) (arguing that the decision of 30 States to ban the partial birth abortion procedure was \\\\\\\"simply irrational\\\\\\\" because other forms of abortion were \\\\\\\"equally gruesome\\\\\\\"); <i>ante,</i> at 951-952 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (similar).<sup>[19]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1009</span> C</h2>\\\\n<p>The next question, therefore, is whether the Nebraska statute is unconstitutional because it does not contain an exception that would allow use of the procedure whenever \\\\\\\"` \\\\\\\"necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the . . . health of the mother.\\\\\\\"` \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 930 (majority opinion) (quoting <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 879, in turn quoting <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 164-165) (emphasis deleted). According to the majority, such a health exception is required here because there is a \\\\\\\"division of opinion among some medical experts over whether D&amp;X is generally safer [than D&amp;E], and an absence of controlled medical studies that would help answer these medical questions.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 936\\u00c2\\u2014 937. In other words, unless a State can conclusively establish that an abortion procedure is no safer than other procedures, the State cannot regulate that procedure without including a health exception. Justice O'Connor agrees. <i>Ante,</i> at 947-948 (concurring opinion). The rule set forth by the majority and Justice O'Connor dramatically expands on our prior abortion cases and threatens to undo <i>any</i> state regulation of abortion procedures.</p>\\\\n<p>The majority and Justice O'Connor suggest that their rule is dictated by a straightforward application of <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey. Ante,</i> at 929-930 (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 947-948 (O'Connor, J., concurring). But that is simply not true. In <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey,</i> the Court stated that the State may \\\\\\\"regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe, supra,</i> at 165; <i>Casey,</i> 505 U. S., at 879. <i>Casey</i> said that a health exception must be available if \\\\\\\"<i>continuing her pregnancy</i> would constitute a threat\\\\\\\" to the woman. <i>Id.,</i> at 880 (majority opinion) (emphasis added). Under these cases, if a State seeks to prohibit abortion, even if only temporarily or under particular circumstances, as <i>Casey</i> says that it may, <i>id.,</i> at 879 (plurality <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1010</span> opinion), the State must make an exception for cases in which the life or health of the mother is endangered by continuing the pregnancy. These cases addressed only the situation in which a woman must obtain an abortion because of some threat to her health from continued pregnancy. But <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> say nothing at all about cases in which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be preferable to permissible methods. Today's majority and Justice O'Connor twist <i>Roe</i> and <i>Casey</i> to apply to the situation in which a woman desires\\u00c2\\u2014for whatever reason\\u00c2\\u2014an abortion and wishes to obtain the abortion by some particular method. See <i>ante,</i> at 929-931 (majority opinion); <i>ante,</i> at 947-948 (concurring opinion). In other words, the majority and Justice O'Connor fail to distinguish between cases in which health concerns require a woman to obtain an abortion and cases in which health concerns cause a woman who desires an abortion (for whatever reason) to prefer one method over another.</p>\\\\n<p>It is clear that the Court's understanding of when a health exception is required is not mandated by our prior cases. In fact, we have, post-<i>Casey,</i> approved regulations of methods of conducting abortion despite the lack of a health exception. <i>Mazurek</i> v. <i>Armstrong,</i> 520 U. S. 968, 971 (1997) <i>(per curiam)</i> (reversing Court of Appeals holding that plaintiffs challenging requirement that only physicians perform abortions had a \\\\\\\"`fair chance of success' \\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 979 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (arguing that the regulation was designed to make abortion more difficult). And one can think of vast bodies of law regulating abortion that are valid, one would hope, despite the lack of health exceptions. For example, physicians are presumably prohibited from using abortifacients that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration even if some physicians reasonably believe <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1011</span> that these abortifacients would be safer for women than existing abortifacients.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The majority effectively concedes that <i>Casey</i> provides no support for its broad health exception rule by relying on pre-<i>Casey</i> authority, see <i>ante,</i> at 931, including a case that was specifically disapproved of in <i>Casey</i> for giving too little weight to the State's interest in fetal life. See <i>Casey, supra,</i>  at 869, 882 (overruling the parts of <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747 (1986), that were \\\\\\\"inconsistent with <i>Roe</i>`s statement that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn,\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 870); <i>id.,</i> at 893 (majority opinion) (relying on <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), for the proposition that the Court was expanding on <i>Roe</i> in that case). Indeed, Justice O'Connor, who joins the Court's opinion, was on the Court for <i>Thornburgh</i> and was in dissent, arguing that, under the undue-burden standard, the statute at issue was constitutional. See 476 U. S., at 828-832 (arguing that the challenged state statute was not \\\\\\\"unduly burdensome\\\\\\\"). The majority's resort to this case proves my point that the holding today assumes that the standard set forth in the <i>Casey</i> joint opinion is no longer governing.</p>\\\\n<p>And even if I were to assume that the pre-<i>Casey</i> standards govern, the cases cited by the majority provide no support for the proposition that the partial birth abortion ban must <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1012</span> include a health exception because some doctors believe that partial birth abortion is safer. In <i>Thornburgh, Danforth,</i>  and <i>Doe,</i> the Court addressed health exceptions for cases in which <i>continued pregnancy</i> would pose a risk to the woman. <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at 770; <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S., at 197. And in <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379 (1979), the Court explicitly declined to address whether a State can constitutionally require a trade off between the woman's health and that of the fetus. The broad rule articulated by the majority and by Justice O'Connor are unprecedented expansions of this Court's already expansive pre-<i>Casey</i>  jurisprudence.</p>\\\\n<p>As if this state of affairs were not bad enough, the majority expands the health exception rule articulated in <i>Casey</i> in one additional and equally pernicious way. Although <i>Roe</i>  and <i>Casey</i> mandated a health exception for cases in which abortion is \\\\\\\"necessary\\\\\\\" for a woman's health, the majority concludes that a procedure is \\\\\\\"necessary\\\\\\\" if it has any comparative health benefits. <i>Ante,</i> at 937. In other words, according to the majority, so long as a doctor can point to support in the profession for his (or the woman's) preferred procedure, it is \\\\\\\"necessary\\\\\\\" and the physician is entitled to perform it. <i>Ibid.</i> See also <i>ante,</i> at 952 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (arguing that a State cannot constitutionally \\\\\\\"sto[p] a woman from choosing the procedure her doctor `reasonably believes' \\\\\\\" is in her best interest). But such a health exception requirement eviscerates <i>Casey</i>`s undue-burden standard and imposes unfettered abortion on demand. The exception entirely swallows the rule. In effect, no regulation of abortion procedures is permitted because there will always be <i>some</i> support for a procedure and there will always be some doctors who conclude that the procedure is preferable. If Nebraska reenacts its partial birth abortion ban with a health exception, the State will not be able to prevent physicians like Dr. Carhart from using partial birth abortion as a routine abortion procedure. This Court has now expressed <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1013</span> its own conclusion that there is \\\\\\\"highly plausible\\\\\\\" support for the view that partial birth abortion is safer, which, in the majority's view, means that the procedure is therefore \\\\\\\"necessary.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 937. Any doctor who wishes to perform such a procedure under the new statute will be able to do so with impunity. Therefore, Justice O'Connor's assurance that the constitutional failings of Nebraska's statute can be easily fixed, <i>ante,</i> at 950-951, is illusory. The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States\\u00c2\\u2014a hostility that <i>Casey</i> purported to reject.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>D</h2>\\\\n<p>The majority assiduously avoids addressing the <i>actual</i>  standard articulated in <i>Casey</i> \\u00c2\\u2014whether prohibiting partial birth abortion without a health exception poses a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion. 505 U. S., at 877. And for good reason: Such an obstacle does not exist. There are two essential reasons why the Court cannot identify a substantial obstacle. First, the Court cannot identify any real, much less substantial, barrier to any woman's ability to obtain an abortion. And second, the Court cannot demonstrate that any such obstacle would affect a sufficient number of women to justify invalidating the statute on its face.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>The <i>Casey</i> joint opinion makes clear that the Court should not strike down state regulations of abortion based on the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1014</span> fact that some women might face a marginally higher health risk from the regulation. In <i>Casey,</i> the Court upheld a 24hour waiting period even though the Court credited evidence that for some women the delay would, in practice, be much longer than 24 hours, and even though it was undisputed that any delay in obtaining an abortion would impose additional health risks. <i>Id.,</i> at 887; <i>id.,</i> at 937 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part) (\\\\\\\"The District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour delay could lead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increasing health risks\\\\\\\"). Although some women would be able to avoid the waiting period because of a \\\\\\\"medical emergency,\\\\\\\" the medical emergency exception in the statute was limited to those women for whom delay would create \\\\\\\"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 902 (appendix to joint opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). Without question, there were women for whom the regulation would impose some additional health risk who would not fall within the medical emergency exception. The Court concluded, despite the certainty of this increased risk, that there was no showing that the burden on any of the women was substantial. <i>Id.,</i>  at 887.</p>\\\\n<p>The only case in which this Court has overturned a State's attempt to prohibit a particular form of abortion also demonstrates that a marginal increase in health risks is not sufficient to create an undue burden. In <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), the Court struck down a state regulation because the State had outlawed the method of abortion used in 70% of abortions and because alternative methods were, the Court emphasized, \\\\\\\"significantly more dangerous and critical\\\\\\\" than the prohibited method. <i>Id.,</i> at 76.</p>\\\\n<p>Like the <i>Casey</i> 24-hour waiting period, and in contrast to the situation in <i>Danforth,</i> any increased health risk to women imposed by the partial birth abortion ban is minimal <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1015</span> at most. Of the 5.5% of abortions that occur after 15 weeks (the time after which a partial birth abortion would be possible), the vast majority are performed with a D&amp;E or induction procedure. And, for any woman with a vertex presentation fetus, the vertex presentation form of intact D&amp;E, which presumably shares some of the health benefits of the partial birth abortion procedure but is not covered by the Nebraska statute, is available. Of the remaining women\\u00c2\\u2014 that is, those women for whom a partial birth abortion procedure would be considered and who have a breech presentation fetus\\u00c2\\u2014there is no showing that any one faces a significant health risk from the partial birth abortion ban. A select committee of ACOG \\\\\\\"could identify no circumstances under which this procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.\\\\\\\" App. 600 (ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997)). See also <i>Hope Clinic</i> v. <i>Ryan,</i> 195 F. 3d 857, 872 (CA7 1999) (en banc) (\\\\\\\"`There does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&amp;X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion' \\\\\\\" (quoting Late Term Pregnancy Techniques, AMA Policy H-5.982 W. D. Wis. 1999)); <i>Planned Parenthood of Wis.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 44 F. Supp. 2d, at 980 (citing testimony of Dr. Haskell that \\\\\\\"the D&amp;X procedure is never medically necessary to . . . preserve the health of a woman\\\\\\\"), vacated, 195 F. 3d 857 (CA7 1999). And, an ad hoc coalition of doctors, including former Surgeon General Koop, concluded that there are no medical conditions that require use of the partial birth abortion procedure to preserve the mother's health. See App. 719.</p>\\\\n<p>In fact, there was evidence before the Nebraska Legislature that partial birth abortion <i>increases</i> health risks relative to other procedures. During floor debates, a proponent of the Nebraska legislation read from and cited several articles by physicians concluding that partial birth abortion procedures are risky. App. in Nos. 98-3245, 98-3300 (CA8), <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1016</span> p. 812. One doctor testifying before a committee of the Nebraska Legislature stated that partial birth abortion involves three \\\\\\\"very risky procedures\\\\\\\": dilation of the cervix, using instruments blindly, and conversion of the fetus. App. 721 (quoting testimony of Paul Hays, M. D.).<sup>[22]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>There was also evidence before Congress that partial birth abortion \\\\\\\"does not meet medical standards set by ACOG nor has it been adequately proven to be safe nor efficacious.\\\\\\\" H. R. 1833 Hearing 112 (statement of Nancy G. Romer, M. D.); see <i>id.,</i> at 110-111.<sup>[23]</sup> The AMA supported the congressional ban on partial birth abortion, concluding that the procedure is \\\\\\\"not medically indicated\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"not good medicine.\\\\\\\" See 143 Cong. Rec. S4670 (May 19, 1997) (reprinting a letter from the AMA to Sen. Santorum). And there was evidence before Congress that there is \\\\\\\"certainly no basis upon which to state the claim that [partial birth abortion] is a safer or even a preferred procedure.\\\\\\\" Partial Birth Abortion: The Truth, S. 6 and H. R. 929 Joint Hearing 123 (statement of Curtis Cook, M. D.). This same doctor testified that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1017</span> \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion is an unnecessary, unsteady, and potentially dangerous procedure,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"safe alternatives are in existence.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 122.</p>\\\\n<p>The majority justifies its result by asserting that a \\\\\\\"significant body of medical opinion\\\\\\\" supports the view that partial birth abortion may be a safer abortion procedure. <i>Ante,</i>  at 937. I find this assertion puzzling. If there is a \\\\\\\"significant body of medical opinion\\\\\\\" supporting this procedure, no one in the majority has identified it. In fact, it is uncontested that although this procedure has been used since at least 1992, no formal studies have compared partial birth abortion with other procedures. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1112 (citing testimony of Dr. Stubblefield); <i>id.,</i> at 1115 (citing testimony of Dr. Boehm); Epner, Jonas, &amp; Seckinger, Late-term Abortion, 280 JAMA 724 (Aug. 26, 1998); Sprang &amp; Neerhof, Rationale for Banning Abortion Late in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998). Cf. <i>Kumho Tire Co.</i> v. <i>Carmichael,</i> 526 U. S. 137, 149-152 (1999) (observing that the reliability of a scientific technique may turn on whether the technique can be and has been tested; whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; and whether there is a high rate of error or standards controlling its operation). The majority's conclusion makes sense only if the undueburden standard is not whether a \\\\\\\"significant body of medical opinion\\\\\\\" supports the result, but rather, as Justice Ginsburg candidly admits, whether <i>any</i> doctor could reasonably believe that the partial birth abortion procedure would best protect the woman. <i>Ante,</i> at 952.</p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, even if I were to assume credible evidence on both sides of the debate, that fact should resolve the undueburden question in favor of allowing Nebraska to legislate. Where no one knows whether a regulation of abortion poses any burden at all, the burden surely does not amount to a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle.\\\\\\\" Under <i>Casey,</i> in such a case we should defer to the legislative judgment. We have said:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1018</span> \\\\\\\"[I]t is precisely where such disagreement exists that legislatures have been afforded the widest latitude in drafting such statutes. . . .

The question, according to the majority, was whether the spousal notice provision operated as a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" to the women \\\\\\\"whose conduct it affects,\\\\\\\" namely, \\\\\\\"married women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify their husbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for one of the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement.\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 895. The Court determined that a \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of the women in this category were victims of psychological or physical abuse. <i>Ibid.</i> For this subset of women, according to the Court, the provision would pose a substantial obstacle to the ability to obtain an abortion because their husbands could exercise an effective veto over their decision. <i>Id.,</i> at 897.</p>\\\\n<p>None of the opinions supporting the majority so much as mentions the large fraction standard, undoubtedly because <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*1020</span> the Nebraska statute easily survives it. I will assume, for the sake of discussion, that the category of women whose conduct Nebraska's partial birth abortion statute might affect includes any woman who wishes to obtain a safe abortion after 16 weeks' gestation. I will also assume (although I doubt it is true) that, of these women, every one would be willing to use the partial birth abortion procedure if so advised by her doctor. Indisputably, there is no \\\\\\\"large fraction\\\\\\\" of these women who would face a substantial obstacle to obtaining a safe abortion because of their inability to use this particular procedure. In fact, it is not clear that <i>any</i>  woman would be deprived of a safe abortion by her inability to obtain a partial birth abortion. More medically sophisticated minds than ours have searched and failed to identify a single circumstance (let alone a large fraction) in which partial birth abortion is required. But no matter. The \\\\\\\"ad hoc nullification\\\\\\\" machine is back at full throttle. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S., at 814 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); <i>Madsen</i>  v. <i>Women's Health Center, Inc.,</i> 512 U. S. 753, 785 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>* * *</h2>\\\\n<p>We were reassured repeatedly in <i>Casey</i> that not all regulations of abortion are unwarranted and that the States may express profound respect for fetal life. Under <i>Casey,</i> the regulation before us today should easily pass constitutional muster. But the Court's abortion jurisprudence is a particularly virulent strain of constitutional exegesis. And so today we are told that 30 States are prohibited from banning one rarely used form of abortion that they believe to border on infanticide. It is clear that the Constitution does not compel this result.</p>\\\\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]   Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for the State of Louisiana et al. by <i>Richard P.

S. 833 (1992), are to the joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  In 1996, the most recent year for which abortion statistics are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were approximately 1,221,585 abortions performed in the United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance\\u00c2\\u2014United States, 1996, p. 1 (July 30, 1999). Of these abortions, about 67,000-5.5%\\u00c2\\u2014were performed in or after the 16th week of gestation, that is, from the middle of the second trimester through the third trimester. <i>Id.,</i> at 5. The majority apparently accepts that none of the abortion procedures used for pregnancies in earlier stages of gestation, including \\\\\\\"dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" (D&amp;E) as it is practiced between 13 and 15 weeks' gestation, would be compromised by the statute. See <i>ante,</i> at 938-940 (concluding that the statute could be interpreted to apply to instrumental dismemberment procedures used in a later term D&amp;E). Therefore, only the methods of abortion available to women in this later stage of pregnancy are at issue in this case.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  At 16 weeks' gestation, the average fetus is approximately six inches long. By 20 weeks' gestation, the fetus is approximately eight inches long. K. Moore &amp; T. Persaud, The Developing Human 112 (6th ed. 1998).</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  Past the 20th week of gestation, respondent attempts to induce fetal death by injection prior to beginning the procedure in patients. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1106; App. 64.</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  There is a disagreement among the parties regarding the appropriate term for this procedure. Congress and numerous state legislatures, including Nebraska's, have described this procedure as \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion,\\\\\\\" reflecting the fact that the fetus is all but born when the physician causes its death. See <i>infra</i> this page and 987. Respondent prefers to refer generically to \\\\\\\"intact dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" without reference to whether the fetus is presented head first or feet first. One of the doctors who developed the procedure, Martin Haskell, described it as \\\\\\\"Dilation and Extraction\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"D&amp;X.\\\\\\\" See The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995, Hearing on H. R. 1833 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1995) (hereinafter H. R. 1833 Hearing). The Executive Board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) refers to the procedure by the hybrid term \\\\\\\"intact dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;X,\\\\\\\" see App. 599 (ACOG Executive Board, Statement on Intact Dilation and Extraction (Jan. 12, 1997)), which term was adopted by the AMA, see <i>id.,</i> at 492 (AMA, Report of the Board of Trustees on Late-Term Abortion). I will use the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" to describe the procedure because it is the legal term preferred by 28 state legislatures, including the State of Nebraska, and by the United States Congress. As I will discuss, see <i>infra,</i> at 999-1001, there is no justification for the majority's preference for the terms \\\\\\\"breech-conversion intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"D&amp;X\\\\\\\" other than the desire to make this procedure appear to be medically sanctioned.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  There is apparently no general understanding of which women are appropriate candidates for the procedure. Respondent uses the procedure on women at 16 to 20 weeks' gestation. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1105. The doctor who developed the procedure, Dr. Martin Haskell, indicated that he performed the procedure on patients 20 through 24 weeks and on certain patients 25 through 26 weeks. See H. R. 1833 Hearing 36.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  There are, in addition, two forms of abortion that are used only rarely: hysterotomy, a procedure resembling a Caesarean section,requires the surgical delivery of the fetus through an incision on the uterine wall, and hysterectomy. 11 F. Supp. 2d, at 1109.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  The majority argues that the statute does not explicitly require that the death-causing procedure be separate from the overall abortion procedure. That is beside the point; under the statute the death-causing procedure must be separate from the <i>delivery.</i> Moreover, it is incorrect to state that the statute contemplates only one \\\\\\\"procedure.\\\\\\\" The statute clearly uses the term \\\\\\\"procedure\\\\\\\" to refer to both the overall abortion procedure (\\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" is \\\\\\\"an abortion procedure\\\\\\\") as well as to a component of the overall abortion procedure (\\\\\\\"for the purpose of performing a procedure . . . that will kill the unborn child\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  It is certainly true that an undefined term must be construed in accordance with its ordinary and plain meaning. <i>FDIC</i> v. <i>Meyer,</i> 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). But this does not mean that the ordinary and plain meaning of a term is wholly irrelevant when that term is defined.</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  As noted, see n. 5,<i>supra,</i> there is no consensus regarding which of these terms is appropriate to describe the procedure. I assume, as the majority does, that the terms are, for purposes here, interchangeable.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  Congressional legislation prohibiting the procedure was first introduced in June 1995, with the introduction of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, H. R. 1833. This measure, which was sponsored by 165 individual House Members, passed both Houses by wide margins, 141 Cong. Rec. 35892 (1995); 142 Cong. Rec. 31169 (1996), but was vetoed by President Clinton, see <i>id.,</i> at 7467. The House voted to override the veto on September 19, 1996, see <i>id.,</i> at 23851; however, the Senate failed to override by a margin of 13 votes, see <i>id.,</i> at 25829. In the next Congress, 181 individual House cosponsors reintroduced the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act as H. R. 929, which was later replaced in the House with H. R. 1122. See H. R. 1122, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). The House and Senate again adopted the legislation, as amended, by wide margins. See 143 Cong. Rec. H1230 (Mar. 20, 1997); <i>id.,</i> at S4715 (May 20, 1997). President Clinton again vetoed the bill. See <i>id.,</i> at H8891 (Oct. 10, 1997). Again, the veto override passed in the House and fell short in the Senate. See 144 Cong. Rec. H6213 (July 23, 1998); <i>id.,</i> at S10564 (Sept. 18, 1998).</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  Consistent with the practice of Dr. Haskell (an Ohio practitioner), Ohio referred to the procedure as \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction,\\\\\\\" defined as \\\\\\\"the termination of a human pregnancy by purposely inserting a suction device into the skull of a fetus to remove the brain.\\\\\\\" Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 2919.15(A) (1997). Missouri refers to the killing of a \\\\\\\"partially-born\\\\\\\" infant as \\\\\\\"infanticide.\\\\\\\" Mo. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 565.300 (Vernon Supp. 2000).</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  For the most part, these States defined the term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" using language similar to that in the 1995 proposed congressional legislation, that is \\\\\\\"an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.\\\\\\\" See H. R. 1833 Hearing 210. See, <i>e. g.,</i> Alaska Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 18.16.050 (1998); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 13-3603.01 (Supp. 1999); Ark.

Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 16-18-2\\u00c2\\u2014267.5 (West Supp. 1999); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 333.17016(5)(c) (West Supp. 2000); Miss.

Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 28-326 (Supp. 1999), defined \\\\\\\"partial-birth abortion\\\\\\\" using language similar to that used in the 1997 proposed congressional legislation, which retained the definition of partial birth abortion used in the 1995 bill,that is \\\\\\\"an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery,\\\\\\\" but further defined that phrase to mean \\\\\\\"deliberately and intentionally delivers into the vagina a living fetus, or a substantial portion there of, for the purpose of performing a procedure the physician knows will kill the fetus, and kills the fetus.\\\\\\\" See Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, H. R. 1122, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). See, <i>e. g.,</i> Idaho Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 18-613(a) (Supp. 1999); Iowa Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 707.8A(1)(c) (Supp. 1999); N. J. Stat.

Code Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 39-15-209(a)(1) (1997).</p>\\\\n<p>[14]  The majority argues that its approach is supported by <i>Meese</i> v. <i>Keene,</i>  481 U. S. 465, 487 (1987), in which the Court stated that \\\\\\\"the statutory definition of [a] term excludes unstated meanings of that term.\\\\\\\" But this case provides no support for the approach adopted by the majority and Justice O'Connor. In <i>Meese,</i> the Court addressed a statute that used the term \\\\\\\"political propaganda.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 470. The Court noted that there were two commonly understood meanings to the term \\\\\\\"political propaganda,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 477, and, not surprisingly, chose the definition that was most consistent with the statutory definition, <i>id.,</i> at 485. Nowhere did the Court suggest that, because \\\\\\\"political propaganda\\\\\\\" was defined in the statute, the commonly understood meanings of that term were irrelevant. Indeed, a significant portion of the Court's opinion was devoted to describing the effect of Congress' use of that term. <i>Id.,</i> at 477-479, 483-484. So too, <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 392-393, n. 10 (1979), and <i>Western Union Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Lenroot,</i> 323 U. S. 490 (1945), support the proposition that when there are two possible interpretations of a term, and only one comports with the statutory definition, the term should not be read to include the unstated meaning. But here, there is only one possible interpretation of \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\"\\u00c2\\u2014the majority can cite no authority using that term to describe D&amp;E\\u00c2\\u2014and so there is no justification for the majority's willingness to entirely disregard the statute's use of that term.</p>\\\\n<p>[15]  Nor, for that matter, did the terms \\\\\\\"intact dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"intact dilation and evacuation\\\\\\\" appear in textbooks or medical dictionaries. See <i>supra,</i> at 999 and this page. In fact, respondent's preferred term \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" would compound, rather than remedy, any confusion regarding the statute's meaning. As is evident from the majority opinion, there is no consensus on what this term means. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 927 (describing \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" to refer to both breech and vertex presentation procedures), with App. 6 (testimony of Dr. Henshaw) (using \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" to mean only breech procedure), with <i>id.,</i> at 275 (testimony of Dr. Stubblefield) (using \\\\\\\"intact D&amp;E\\\\\\\" to refer to delivery of fetus that has died in utero).</p>\\\\n<p>[16]  The fact that the statutory term \\\\\\\"partial birth abortion\\\\\\\" may express a political or moral judgment, whereas \\\\\\\"dilation and extraction\\\\\\\" does not, is irrelevant. It is certainly true that technical terms are frequently empty of normative content. (Of course, the decision to use a technical term can itself be normative. See <i>ante, passim</i> (majority opinion)). But, so long as statutory terms are adequately defined, there is no requirement that Congress or state legislatures draft statutes using morally agnostic terminology. See, <i>e. g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 922(v) (making it unlawful to \\\\\\\"manufacture, transfer, or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon\\\\\\\"); Kobayashi &amp; Olson et al.,<i>In re 101 California Street:</i> A Legal and Economic Analysis of Strict Liability for the Manufacture and Sale of \\\\\\\"Assault Weapons,\\\\\\\" 8 Stan. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. 41, 43 (1997) (\\\\\\\"Prior to 1989, the term `assault weapon' did not exist in the lexicon of firearms. It is a political term, developed by anti-gun publicists to expand the category of `assault rifles' so as to allow an attack on as many additional firearms as possible on the basis of undefined `evil' appearance\\\\\\\"). See also <i>Meese,</i> 481 U. S., at 484-485.</p>\\\\n<p>[17]  The majority relies on Justice Scalia's observation in <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 494 U. S. 152 (1990), that \\\\\\\"we have never thought that the interpretation of those charged with prosecuting criminal statutes is entitled to deference.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 177. But Justice Scalia was commenting on the United States Attorney General's overly broad interpretation of a federal statute, deference to which, as he said, would \\\\\\\"turn the normal construction of criminal statutes upside-down, replacing the doctrine of lenity with a doctrine of severity.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178. Here, the Nebraska Attorney General has adopted a <i>narrow</i> view of a criminal statute, one that comports with the rule of lenity (not to mention the statute's plain meaning).</p>\\\\n<p>[18]  I read the majority opinion to concede, if only implicitly, that the State has a legitimate interest in banning this dehumanizing procedure. The threshold question under <i>Casey</i> is whether the abortion regulation serves a legitimate state interest. 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Only if the statute serves a legitimate state interest is it necessary to consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial obstacle to women seeking an abortion. <i>Ibid.</i> The fact that the majority considers whether Nebraska's statute creates a substantial obstacle suggests that the Members of the majority other than Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg have rejected respondent's threshold argument that the statute serves no legitimate state purpose.</p>\\\\n<p>[19]  Justice Ginsburg seems to suggest that even if the Nebraska statute does not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions, the statute is unconstitutional because it has the <i>purpose</i> of imposing an undue burden. Justice Ginsburg's view is, apparently, that we can presume an unconstitutional purpose because the regulation is not designed to save any fetus from \\\\\\\"destruction\\\\\\\" or protect the health of pregnant women and so must, therefore, be designed to \\\\\\\"chip away at . . . <i>Roe.</i> \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 952. This is a strange claim to make with respect to legislation that was enacted in 30 individual States and was enacted in Nebraska by a vote of 45 to 1, Nebraska Legislative Journal, 95th Leg., 1st Sess., 2609 (1997). Moreover, in support of her assertion that the Nebraska Legislature acted with an unconstitutional purpose, Justice Ginsburg is apparently unable to muster a single shred of evidence that the Nebraska legislation was enacted to prevent women from obtaining abortions (a purpose to which it would be entirely ineffective), let alone the kind of persuasive proof we would require before concluding that a legislature acted with an unconstitutional intent. In fact, as far as I can tell, Justice Ginsburg's views regarding the motives of the Nebraska Legislature derive from the views of a dissenting Court of Appeals judge discussing the motives of legislators of other States. Justice Ginsburg's presumption is, in addition, squarely inconsistent with <i>Casey,</i> which stated that States may enact legislation to \\\\\\\"express profound respect for the life of the unborn,\\\\\\\" 505 U. S., at 877, and with our opinion in <i>Mazurek</i> v. <i>Armstrong,</i> 520 U. S. 968 (1997) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> in which we stated: \\\\\\\"[E]ven assuming . . . that a legislative <i>purpose</i> to interfere with the constitutionally protected right to abortion without the <i>effect</i> of interfering with that right . . . could render the Montana law invalid\\u00c2\\u2014there is no basis for finding a vitiating legislative purpose here. We do not assume unconstitutional legislative intent even when statutes produce harmful results, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 426 U. S. 229, 246 (1976); much less do we assume it when the results are harmless.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 972 (emphases in original).</p>\\\\n<p>[20]  As I discuss below, the only question after <i>Casey</i> is whether a ban on partial birth abortion without a health exception imposes an \\\\\\\"undue burden\\\\\\\" on a woman seeking an abortion, meaning that it creates a \\\\\\\"substantial obstacle\\\\\\\" for the woman. I assume that the Court does not discuss the health risks with respect to undue burden, and instead suggests that health risks are relevant to the necessity of a health exception, because a marginal increase in safety risk for some women is clearly not an undue burden within the meaning of <i>Casey.</i> At bottom, the majority is using the health exception language to water down <i>Casey</i>`s undue-burden standard.</p>\\\\n<p>[21]  The majority's conclusion that health exceptions are required whenever there is any support for use of a procedure is particularly troubling because the majority does not indicate whether an exception for physical health only is required, or whether the exception would have to account for \\\\\\\"all factors\\u00c2\\u2014physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age\\u00c2\\u2014relevant to the well being of the patient.\\\\\\\" <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 192 (1973). See also <i>Voinovich</i> v.<i>Women's Medical Professional Corp.,</i> 523 U. S. 1036, 1037 (1998) (Thomas, J.,joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).</p>\\\\n<p>[22]  Use of the procedure may increase the risk of complications, including cervical incompetence, because it requires greater dilation of the cervix than other forms of abortion. See Epner, Jonas, &amp; Seckinger, Late-term Abortion, 280 JAMA 724, 726 (Aug. 26, 1998). Physicians have also suggested that the procedure may pose a greater risk of infection. See <i>Planned Parenthood</i> of <i>Wis.</i> v. <i>Doyle,</i> 44 F. Supp. 2d 975, 979 (WD Wis. 1999). See also Sprang &amp; Neerhof, Rationale for Banning Abortions Late in Pregnancy, 280 JAMA 744 (Aug. 26, 1998) (\\\\\\\"Intact D&amp;X poses serious medical risks to the mother\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>[23]  Nebraska was entitled to rely on testimony and evidence presented to Congress and to other state legislatures.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit struck down several provisions of the statute on the ground that they violated this Court's decision in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and cases following it. We noted probable jurisdiction, 488 U. S. 1003 (1989), and now reverse.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*500</span> I</h2>\\\\n<p>In June 1986, the Governor of Missouri signed into law Missouri Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1596 (hereinafter Act or statute), which amended existing state law concerning unborn children and abortions.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*501</span> The Act consisted of 20 provisions, 5 of which are now before the Court. The first provision, or preamble, contains \\\\\\\"findings\\\\\\\" by the state legislature that \\\\\\\"[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act further requires that all Missouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the same rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the Federal Constitution and this Court's precedents. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.2. Among its other provisions, the Act requires that, prior to performing an abortion on any woman whom a physician has reason to believe is 20 or more weeks pregnant, the physician ascertain whether the fetus is viable by performing \\\\\\\"such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029. The Act also prohibits the use of public employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life, and it prohibits the use of public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of \\\\\\\"encouraging or counseling\\\\\\\" a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205, 188.210, 188.215.</p>\\\\n<p>In July 1986, five health professionals employed by the State and two nonprofit corporations brought this class action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to challenge the constitutionality of the Missouri statute. Plaintiffs, appellees in this Court, sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that certain statutory provisions violated the First, Fourth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. App. A9. They asserted violations of various rights, including the \\\\\\\"privacy <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*502</span> rights of pregnant women seeking abortions\\\\\\\"; the \\\\\\\"woman's right to an abortion\\\\\\\"; the \\\\\\\"righ[t] to privacy in the physician-patient relationship\\\\\\\"; the physician's \\\\\\\"righ[t] to practice medicine\\\\\\\"; the pregnant woman's \\\\\\\"right to life due to inherent risks involved in childbirth\\\\\\\"; and the woman's right to \\\\\\\"receive . . . adequate medical advice and treatment\\\\\\\" concerning abortions. <i>Id.,</i> at A17-A19.</p>\\\\n<p>Plaintiffs filed this suit \\\\\\\"on their own behalf and on behalf of the entire class consisting of facilities and Missouri licensed physicians or other health care professionals offering abortion services or pregnancy counseling and on behalf of the entire class of pregnant females seeking abortion services or pregnancy counseling within the State of Missouri.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at A13. The two nonprofit corporations are Reproductive Health Services, which offers family planning and gynecological services to the public, including abortion services up to 22 weeks \\\\\\\"gestational age,\\\\\\\"<sup>[2]</sup> and Planned Parenthood of Kansas City, which provides abortion services up to 14 weeks gestational age. <i>Id.,</i> at A9-A10. The individual plaintiffs are three physicians, one nurse, and a social worker. All are \\\\\\\"public employees\\\\\\\" at \\\\\\\"public facilities\\\\\\\" in Missouri, and they are paid for their services with \\\\\\\"public funds,\\\\\\\" as those terms are defined by \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200. The individual plaintiffs, within the scope of their public employment, encourage and counsel pregnant women to have nontherapeutic abortions. Two of the physicians perform abortions. App. A54-A55.</p>\\\\n<p>Several weeks after the complaint was filed, the District Court temporarily restrained enforcement of several provisions of the Act. Following a 3-day trial in December 1986, the District Court declared seven provisions of the Act unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement. 662 F. Supp. 407 (WD Mo. 1987). These provisions included the preamble, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205; the \\\\\\\"informed consent\\\\\\\" provision, which required <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*503</span> physicians to inform the pregnant woman of certain facts before performing an abortion, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.039; the requirement that post-16-week abortions be performed only in hospitals, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.025; the mandated tests to determine viability, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029; and the prohibition on the use of public funds, employees, and facilities to perform or assist nontherapeutic abortions, and the restrictions on the use of public funds, employees, and facilities to encourage or counsel women to have such abortions, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205, 188.210, 188.215. <i>Id.,</i> at 430.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, with one exception not relevant to this appeal. 851 F. 2d 1071 (1988). The Court of Appeals determined that Missouri's declaration that life begins at conception was \\\\\\\"simply an impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its abortion regulations.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1076. Relying on <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 388-389 (1979), it further held that the requirement that physicians perform viability tests was an unconstitutional legislative intrusion on a matter of medical skill and judgment. 851 F. 2d, at 1074-1075. The Court of Appeals invalidated Missouri's prohibition on the use of public facilities and employees to perform or assist abortions not necessary to save the mother's life. <i>Id.,</i> at 1081-1083. It distinguished our decisions in <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297 (1980), and <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), on the ground that \\\\\\\" `[t]here is a fundamental difference between providing direct funding to effect the abortion decision and allowing staff physicians to perform abortions at an existing publicly owned hospital.' \\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1081, quoting <i>Nyberg</i> v. <i>City of Virginia,</i> 667 F. 2d 754, 758 (CA8 1982), appeal dism'd, 462 U. S. 1125 (1983). The Court of Appeals struck down the provision prohibiting the use of public funds for \\\\\\\"encouraging or counseling\\\\\\\" women to have nontherapeutic abortions, for the reason that this provision was both overly vague and inconsistent with the right to an abortion enunciated in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> 851 F. 2d, at 1077-1080. The court also invalidated the hospitalization <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*504</span> requirement for 16-week abortions, <i>id.,</i> at 1073-1074, and the prohibition on the use of public employees and facilities for abortion counseling, <i>id.,</i> at 1077-1080, but the State has not appealed those parts of the judgment below. See Juris. Statement I-II.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>Decision of this case requires us to address four sections of the Missouri Act: (a) the preamble; (b) the prohibition on the use of public facilities or employees to perform abortions; (c) the prohibition on public funding of abortion counseling; and (d) the requirement that physicians conduct viability tests prior to performing abortions. We address these <i>seriatim.</i></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>The Act's preamble, as noted, sets forth \\\\\\\"findings\\\\\\\" by the Missouri Legislature that \\\\\\\"[t]he life of each human being begins at conception,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"[u]nborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1), (2) (1986). The Act then mandates that state laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with \\\\\\\"all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state,\\\\\\\" subject to the Constitution and this Court's precedents. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.2.<sup>[4]</sup> In invalidating <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*505</span> the preamble, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court's dictum that \\\\\\\" `a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions.' \\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1075-1076, quoting <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 444 (1983), in turn citing <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 159-162. It rejected Missouri's claim that the preamble was \\\\\\\"abortion-neutral,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"merely determine[d] when life begins in a nonabortion context, a traditional state prerogative.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1076. The court thought that \\\\\\\"[t]he only plausible inference\\\\\\\" from the fact that \\\\\\\"every remaining section of the bill save one regulates the performance of abortions\\\\\\\" was that \\\\\\\"the state intended its abortion regulations to be understood against the backdrop of its theory of life.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[5]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The State contends that the preamble itself is precatory and imposes no substantive restrictions on abortions, and that appellees therefore do not have standing to challenge it. Brief for Appellants 21-24. Appellees, on the other hand, insist that the preamble is an operative part of the Act intended to guide the interpretation of other provisions of the Act. Brief for Appellees 19-23. They maintain, for example, that the preamble's definition of life may prevent physicians <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*506</span> in public hospitals from dispensing certain forms of contraceptives, such as the intrauterine device. <i>Id.,</i> at 22.</p>\\\\n<p>In our view, the Court of Appeals misconceived the meaning of the <i>Akron</i> dictum, which was only that a State could not \\\\\\\"justify\\\\\\\" an abortion regulation otherwise invalid under <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> on the ground that it embodied the State's view about when life begins. Certainly the preamble does not by its terms regulate abortion or any other aspect of appellees' medical practice. The Court has emphasized that <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> \\\\\\\"implies no limitation on the authority of a State to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S., at 474. The preamble can be read simply to express that sort of value judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>We think the extent to which the preamble's language might be used to interpret other state statutes or regulations is something that only the courts of Missouri can definitively decide. State law has offered protections to unborn children in tort and probate law, see <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 161-162, and \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.2 can be interpreted to do no more than that. What we have, then, is much the same situation that the Court confronted in <i>Alabama State Federation of Labor</i> v. <i>McAdory,</i> 325 U. S. 450 (1945). As in that case:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"We are thus invited to pass upon the constitutional validity of a state statute which has not yet been applied or threatened to be applied by the state courts to petitioners or others in the manner anticipated. Lacking any authoritative construction of the statute by the state courts, without which no constitutional question arises, and lacking the authority to give such a controlling construction ourselves, and with a record which presents no concrete set of facts to which the statute is to be applied, the case is plainly not one to be disposed of by the declaratory judgment procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 460.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>It will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaning of the preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities of appellees in some concrete way. Until then, this <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*507</span> Court \\\\\\\"is not empowered to decide . . . abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it.\\\\\\\" <i>Tyler</i> v. <i>Judges of Court of Registration,</i> 179 U. S. 405, 409 (1900). See also <i>Valley Forge Christian College</i> v. <i>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc.,</i> 454 U. S. 464, 473 (1982).<sup>[6]</sup> We therefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the Act's preamble.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Section 188.210 provides that \\\\\\\"[i]t shall be unlawful for any public employee within the scope of his employment to perform or assist an abortion, not necessary to save the life of the mother,\\\\\\\" while \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.215 makes it \\\\\\\"unlawful for any public facility to be used for the purpose of performing or assisting an abortion not necessary to save the life of the mother.\\\\\\\"<sup>[7]</sup> The Court of Appeals held that these provisions contravened this Court's abortion decisions. 851 F. 2d, at 1082-1083. We take the contrary view.</p>\\\\n<p>As we said earlier this Term in <i>DeShaney</i> v. <i>Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services,</i> 489 U. S. 189, 196 (1989): \\\\\\\"[O]ur cases have recognized that the Due Process Clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.\\\\\\\" In <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe, supra</i><i>,</i> the Court upheld a Connecticut welfare regulation under which Medicaid recipients received payments for medical services related <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*508</span> to childbirth, but not for nontherapeutic abortions. The Court rejected the claim that this unequal subsidization of childbirth and abortion was impermissible under <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> As the Court put it:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The Connecticut regulation before us is different in kind from the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions. The Connecticut regulation places no obstacles \\u00c2\\u2014 absolute or otherwise \\u00c2\\u2014 in the pregnant woman's path to an abortion. An indigent woman who desires an abortion suffers no disadvantage as a consequence of Connecticut's decision to fund childbirth; she continues as before to be dependent on private sources for the service she desires. The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative, thereby influencing the woman's decision, but it has imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there. The indigency that may make it difficult \\u00c2\\u2014 and in some cases, perhaps, impossible \\u00c2\\u2014 for some women to have abortions is neither created nor in any way affected by the Connecticut regulation.\\\\\\\" 432 U. S., at 474.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>Relying on <i>Maher,</i> the Court in <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519, 521 (1977), held that the city of St. Louis committed \\\\\\\"no constitutional violation . . . in electing, as a policy choice, to provide publicly financed hospital services for childbirth without providing corresponding services for nontherapeutic abortions.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>More recently, in <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297 (1980), the Court upheld \\\\\\\"the most restrictive version of the Hyde Amendment,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 325, n. 27, which withheld from States federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse the costs of abortions, \\\\\\\" `except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting Pub. L. 94-439, \\u00c2\\u00a7 209, 90 Stat. 1434). As in <i>Maher</i> and <i>Poelker,</i> the Court required only a showing that Congress' authorization of \\\\\\\"reimbursement for medically necessary services generally, but not for certain medically necessary <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*509</span> abortions\\\\\\\" was rationally related to the legitimate governmental goal of encouraging childbirth. 448 U. S., at 325.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals distinguished these cases on the ground that \\\\\\\"[t]o prevent access to a public facility does more than demonstrate a political choice in favor of childbirth; it clearly narrows and in some cases forecloses the availability of abortion to women.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1081. The court reasoned that the ban on the use of public facilities \\\\\\\"could prevent a woman's chosen doctor from performing an abortion because of his unprivileged status at other hospitals or because a private hospital adopted a similar anti-abortion stance.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> It also thought that \\\\\\\"[s]uch a rule could increase the cost of obtaining an abortion and delay the timing of it as well.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>We think that this analysis is much like that which we rejected in <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>McRae.</i> As in those cases, the State's decision here to use public facilities and staff to encourage childbirth over abortion \\\\\\\"places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S., at 315. Just as Congress' refusal to fund abortions in <i>McRae</i> left \\\\\\\"an indigent woman with at least the same range of choice in deciding whether to obtain a medically necessary abortion as she would have had if Congress had chosen to subsidize no health care costs at all,\\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 317, Missouri's refusal to allow public employees to perform abortions in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the State had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all. The challenged provisions only restrict a woman's ability to obtain an abortion to the extent that she chooses to use a physician affiliated with a public hospital. This circumstance is more easily remedied, and thus considerably less burdensome, than indigency, which \\\\\\\"may make it difficult \\u00c2\\u2014 and in some cases, perhaps, impossible \\u00c2\\u2014 for some women to have abortions\\\\\\\" without public funding. <i>Maher,</i> 432 U. S., at 474. Having held that the State's refusal to fund abortions does not violate <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> it strains logic to reach a contrary result for the use <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*510</span> of public facilities and employees. If the State may \\\\\\\"make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion and . . . implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds,\\\\\\\" <i>Maher, supra,</i> at 474, surely it may do so through the allocation of other public resources, such as hospitals and medical staff.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish our cases on the additional ground that \\\\\\\"[t]he evidence here showed that all of the public facility's costs in providing abortion services are recouped when the patient pays.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1083. Absent any expenditure of public funds, the court thought that Missouri was \\\\\\\"expressing\\\\\\\" more than \\\\\\\"its preference for childbirth over abortions,\\\\\\\" but rather was creating an \\\\\\\"obstacle to exercise of the right to choose an abortion [that could not] stand absent a compelling state interest.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> We disagree.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"Constitutional concerns are greatest,\\\\\\\" we said in <i>Maher, supra,</i> at 476, \\\\\\\"when the State attempts to impose its will by the force of law; the State's power to encourage actions deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader.\\\\\\\" Nothing in the Constitution requires States to enter or remain in the business of performing abortions. Nor, as appellees suggest, do private physicians and their patients have some kind of constitutional right of access to public facilities for the performance of abortions. Brief for Appellees 46-47. Indeed, if the State does recoup all of its costs in performing abortions, and no state subsidy, direct or indirect, is available, it is difficult to see how any procreational choice is burdened by the State's ban on the use of its facilities or employees for performing abortions.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*511</span> <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>McRae</i> all support the view that the State need not commit any resources to facilitating abortions, even if it can turn a profit by doing so. In <i>Poelker,</i> the suit was filed by an indigent who could not afford to pay for an abortion, but the ban on the performance of nontherapeutic abortions in city-owned hospitals applied whether or not the pregnant woman could pay. 432 U. S., at 520; <i>id.,</i> at 524 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).<sup>[9]</sup> The Court emphasized that the mayor's decision to prohibit abortions in city hospitals was \\\\\\\"subject to public debate and approval or disapproval at the polls,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"the Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth as St. Louis has done.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 521. Thus we uphold the Act's restrictions on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or assistance of nontherapeutic abortions.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>The Missouri Act contains three provisions relating to \\\\\\\"encouraging or counseling a woman to have an abortion not necessary to save her life.\\\\\\\" Section 188.205 states that no public funds can be used for this purpose; \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.210 states that public employees cannot, within the scope of their employment, engage in such speech; and \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.215 forbids such speech in public facilities. The Court of Appeals did not consider \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 separately from \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.210 and 188.215. It held that all three of these provisions were unconstitutionally vague, and that \\\\\\\"the ban on using public funds, employees, and facilities to encourage or counsel a woman to have an abortion is an unacceptable infringement of the woman's fourteenth amendment right to choose an abortion after receiving <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*512</span> the medical information necessary to exercise the right knowingly and intelligently.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1079.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Missouri has chosen only to appeal the Court of Appeals' invalidation of the public funding provision, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205. See Juris. Statement I-II. A threshold question is whether this provision reaches primary conduct, or whether it is simply an instruction to the State's fiscal officers not to allocate funds for abortion counseling. We accept, for purposes of decision, the State's claim that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 \\\\\\\"is not directed at the conduct of any physician or health care provider, private or public,\\\\\\\" but \\\\\\\"is directed solely at those persons responsible for expending public funds.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellants 43.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Appellees contend that they are not \\\\\\\"adversely\\\\\\\" affected under the State's interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205, and therefore that there is no longer a case or controversy before us on this question. Brief for Appellees 31-32. Plaintiffs are masters of their complaints and remain so at the appellate stage of a litigation. See <i>Caterpillar Inc.</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 482 U. S. 386, 398-399 (1987). A majority of the Court agrees with appellees that the controversy over \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 is now moot, because appellees' argument amounts to a decision to no longer seek a declaratory judgment that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 is unconstitutional and accompanying declarative relief. See <i>Deakins</i> v. <i>Monaghan,</i> 484 U. S. 193, 199-201 (1988); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Munsingwear, Inc.,</i> 340 U. S. 36, 39-40 (1950). We accordingly direct the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment of the District Court <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*513</span> with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the complaint. <i>Deakins,</i> 484 U.

In making this determination of viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child and shall enter such findings and determination of viability in the medical record of the mother.\\\\\\\"<sup>[12]</sup></blockquote>\\\\n<p>As with the preamble, the parties disagree over the meaning of this statutory provision. The State emphasizes the language of the first sentence, which speaks in terms of the physician's determination of viability being made by the standards of ordinary skill in the medical profession. Brief for Appellants 32-35. Appellees stress the language of the second sentence, which prescribes such \\\\\\\"tests as are necessary\\\\\\\" to make a finding of gestational age, fetal weight, and lung maturity. Brief for Appellees 26-30.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*514</span> The Court of Appeals read \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 as requiring that after 20 weeks \\\\\\\"doctors <i>must</i> perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1075, n. 5. The court indicated that the tests needed to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are \\\\\\\"unreliable and inaccurate\\\\\\\" and would add $125 to $250 to the cost of an abortion. <i>Ibid.</i> It also stated that \\\\\\\"amniocentesis, the only method available to determine lung maturity, is contrary to accepted medical practice until 28-30 weeks of gestation, expensive, and imposes significant health risks for both the pregnant woman and the fetus.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\\\\n<p>We must first determine the meaning of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 under Missouri law. Our usual practice is to defer to the lower court's construction of a state statute, but we believe the Court of Appeals has \\\\\\\"fallen into plain error\\\\\\\" in this case. <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474, 483 (1988); see <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U. S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1985). \\\\\\\" `In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.' \\\\\\\" <i>Philbrook</i> v. <i>Glodgett,</i> 421 U.

S. 395, 402-403 (1975); <i>Kokoszka</i> v. <i>Belford,</i> 417 U. S. 642, 650 (1974). The Court of Appeals' interpretation also runs \\\\\\\"afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.\\\\\\\" <i>Frisby, supra,</i> at 483.</p>\\\\n<p>We think the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to viability. If we construe this provision to require a physician to perform those tests needed to make the three specified findings <i>in all circumstances,</i> including when the physician's reasonable professional judgment indicates that the tests would be irrelevant to determining viability or even dangerous to the mother and the fetus, the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 would <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*515</span> conflict with the first sentence's <i>requirement</i> that a physician apply his reasonable professional skill and judgment. It would also be incongruous to read this provision, especially the word \\\\\\\"necessary,\\\\\\\"<sup>[13]</sup> to require the performance of tests irrelevant to the expressed statutory purpose of determining viability. It thus seems clear to us that the Court of Appeals' construction of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 violates well-accepted canons of statutory interpretation used in the Missouri courts, see <i>State ex rel. Stern Brothers &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Stilley,</i> 337 S. W. 2d 934, 939 (Mo. 1960) (\\\\\\\"The basic rule of statutory construction is to first seek the legislative intention, and to effectuate it if possible, and the law favors constructions which harmonize with reason, and which tend to avoid unjust, absurd, unreasonable or confiscatory results, or oppression\\\\\\\"); <i>Bell</i> v. <i>Mid-Century Ins. Co.,</i> 750 S. W. 2d 708, 710 (Mo. App. 1988) (\\\\\\\"Interpreting the phrase literally would produce an absurd result, which the Legislature is strongly presumed not to have intended\\\\\\\"), which JUSTICE BLACKMUN ignores. <i>Post,</i> at 545-546.</p>\\\\n<p>The viability-testing provision of the Missouri Act is concerned with promoting the State's interest in potential human life rather than in maternal health. Section 188.029 creates what is essentially a presumption of viability at 20 weeks, which the physician must rebut with tests indicating that the fetus is not viable prior to performing an abortion. It also directs the physician's determination as to viability by specifying consideration, if feasible, of gestational age, fetal weight, and lung capacity. The District Court found that \\\\\\\"the medical evidence is uncontradicted that a 20-week fetus is <i>not</i> viable,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"23 1/2 to 24 weeks gestation is the earliest point in pregnancy where a reasonable possibility of viability <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*516</span> exists.\\\\\\\" 662 F. Supp., at 420. But it also found that there may be a 4-week error in estimating gestational age, <i>id.,</i> at 421, which supports testing at 20 weeks.</p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> the Court recognized that the State has \\\\\\\"important and legitimate\\\\\\\" interests in protecting maternal health and in the potentiality of human life. 410 U. S., at 162. During the second trimester, the State \\\\\\\"may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 164. After viability, when the State's interest in potential human life was held to become compelling, the State \\\\\\\"may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 165.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>In <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379 (1979), upon which appellees rely, the Court held that a Pennsylvania statute regulating the standard of care to be used by a physician performing an abortion of a possibly viable fetus was void for vagueness. <i>Id.,</i> at 390-401. But in the course of reaching that conclusion, the Court reaffirmed its earlier statement in <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 64 (1976), that \\\\\\\" `the determination of whether a particular <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*517</span> fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.' \\\\\\\" 439 U. S., at 396. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, <i>post,</i> at 545, n. 6, ignores the statement in <i>Colautti</i> that \\\\\\\"neither the legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering into the ascertainment of viability \\u00c2\\u2014 be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor \\u00c2\\u2014 as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\\\\\\" 439 U. S., at 388-389. To the extent that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 regulates the method for determining viability, it undoubtedly does superimpose state regulation on the medical determination whether a particular fetus is viable. The Court of Appeals and the District Court thought it unconstitutional for this reason. 851 F. 2d, at 1074-1075; 662 F. Supp., at 423. To the extent that the viability tests increase the cost of what are in fact second-trimester abortions, their validity may also be questioned under <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S., at 434-435, where the Court held that a requirement that second-trimester abortions must be performed in hospitals was invalid because it substantially increased the expense of those procedures.</p>\\\\n<p>We think that the doubt cast upon the Missouri statute by these cases is not so much a flaw in the statute as it is a reflection of the fact that the rigid trimester analysis of the course of a pregnancy enunciated in <i>Roe</i> has resulted in subsequent cases like <i>Colautti</i> and <i>Akron</i> making constitutional law in this area a virtual Procrustean bed. Statutes specifying elements of informed consent to be provided abortion patients, for example, were invalidated if they were thought to \\\\\\\"structur[e] . . . the dialogue between the woman and her physician.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 763 (1986). As the dissenters in <i>Thornburgh</i> pointed out, such a statute would have been sustained under any traditional standard of judicial review, <i>id.,</i> at 802 (WHITE, J., dissenting), or for any other surgical procedure except abortion. <i>Id.,</i> at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*518</span> <i>Stare decisis</i> is a cornerstone of our legal system, but it has less power in constitutional cases, where, save for constitutional amendments, this Court is the only body able to make needed changes. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Scott,</i> 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978). We have not refrained from reconsideration of a prior construction of the Constitution that has proved \\\\\\\"unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.\\\\\\\" <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985); see <i>Solorio</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 483 U. S. 435, 448-450 (1987); <i>Erie R. Co.</i> v. <i>Tompkins,</i> 304 U. S. 64, 74-78 (1938). We think the <i>Roe</i> trimester framework falls into that category.</p>\\\\n<p>In the first place, the rigid <i>Roe</i> framework is hardly consistent with the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does. The key elements of the <i>Roe</i> framework \\u00c2\\u2014 trimesters and viability \\u00c2\\u2014 are not found in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one would expect to find a constitutional principle. Since the bounds of the inquiry are essentially indeterminate, the result has been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations rather than a body of constitutional doctrine.<sup>[15]</sup> As JUSTICE WHITE has put it, the trimester framework <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*519</span> has left this Court to serve as the country's \\\\\\\"<i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 99 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Cf. <i>Garcia, supra,</i> at 547.</p>\\\\n<p>In the second place, we do not see why the State's interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability, and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before viability. The dissenters in <i>Thornburgh,</i> writing in the context of the <i>Roe</i> trimester analysis, would have recognized this fact by positing against the \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" recognized in <i>Roe</i> the State's \\\\\\\"compelling interest\\\\\\\" in protecting potential human life throughout pregnancy. \\\\\\\"[T]he State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 795 (WHITE, J., dissenting); see <i>id.,</i> at 828 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"State has compelling interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life, and these interests exist `throughout pregnancy' \\\\\\\") (citation omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>The tests that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 requires the physician to perform are designed to determine viability. The State here has chosen viability as the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded. See Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.030 (1986) (\\\\\\\"No abortion of a viable unborn child shall be performed unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman\\\\\\\"). It is true that the tests in question increase the expense of abortion, and regulate the discretion of the physician in determining the viability of the fetus. Since the tests will undoubtedly show in many cases that the fetus is not viable, the tests will have been performed for what were in fact second-trimester abortions. But we are satisfied that the requirement of these tests permissibly furthers <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*520</span> the State's interest in protecting potential human life, and we therefore believe \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 to be constitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN takes us to task for our failure to join in a \\\\\\\"great issues\\\\\\\" debate as to whether the Constitution includes an \\\\\\\"unenumerated\\\\\\\" general right to privacy as recognized in cases such as <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), and <i>Roe.</i> But <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut</i><i>,</i> unlike <i>Roe,</i> did not purport to adopt a whole framework, complete with detailed rules and distinctions, to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest would apply. As such, it was far different from the opinion, if not the holding, of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> which sought to establish a constitutional framework for judging state regulation of abortion during the entire term of pregnancy. That framework sought to deal with areas of medical practice traditionally subject to state regulation, and it sought to balance once and for all by reference only to the calendar the claims of the State to protect the fetus as a form of human life against the claims of a woman to decide for herself whether or not to abort a fetus she was carrying. The experience of the Court in applying <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> in later cases, see <i>supra,</i> at 518, n. 15, suggests to us that there is wisdom in not unnecessarily attempting to elaborate the abstract differences between a \\\\\\\"fundamental right\\\\\\\" to abortion, as the Court described it in <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S. at 420, n. 1, a \\\\\\\"limited fundamental constitutional right,\\\\\\\" which JUSTICE BLACKMUN today treats <i>Roe</i> as having established, <i>post,</i> at 555, or a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause, which we believe it to be. The Missouri testing requirement here is reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where the fetus is viable \\u00c2\\u2014 an end which all concede is legitimate \\u00c2\\u2014 and that is sufficient to sustain its constitutionality.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN also accuses us, <i>inter alia,</i> of cowardice and illegitimacy in dealing with \\\\\\\"the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our time.\\\\\\\" <i>Post,</i> at 559. There is <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*521</span> no doubt that our holding today will allow some governmental regulation of abortion that would have been prohibited under the language of cases such as <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379 (1979), and <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra</i><i>.</i> But the goal of constitutional adjudication is surely not to remove inexorably \\\\\\\"politically divisive\\\\\\\" issues from the ambit of the legislative process, whereby the people through their elected representatives deal with matters of concern to them. The goal of constitutional adjudication is to hold true the balance between that which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that which it does not. We think we have done that today. JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S suggestion, <i>post,</i> at 538, 557-558, that legislative bodies, in a Nation where more than half of our population is women, will treat our decision today as an invitation to enact abortion regulation reminiscent of the Dark Ages not only misreads our views but does scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who elect them.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>III</h2>\\\\n<p>Both appellants and the United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> have urged that we overrule our decision in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> Brief for Appellants 12-18; Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8-24. The facts of the present case, however, differ from those at issue in <i>Roe.</i> Here, Missouri has determined that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human life must be safeguarded. In <i>Roe,</i> on the other hand, the Texas statute criminalized the performance of <i>all</i> abortions, except when the mother's life was at stake. 410 U. S., at 117-118. This case therefore affords us no occasion to revisit the holding of <i>Roe,</i> which was that the Texas statute unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion derived from the Due Process Clause, <i>id.,</i> at 164, and we leave it undisturbed. To the extent indicated in our opinion, we would modify and narrow <i>Roe</i> and succeeding cases.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*522A</span> Because none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\\\\n<p><i>Reversed.</i></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*522B</span> JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>Nothing in the record before us or the opinions below indicates that subsections 1(1) and 1(2) of the preamble to Missouri's abortion regulation statute will affect a woman's decision to have an abortion. JUSTICE STEVENS, following appellees, see Brief for Appellees 22, suggests that the preamble may also \\\\\\\"interfer[e] with contraceptive choices,\\\\\\\" <i>post,</i> at 564, because certain contraceptive devices act on a female ovum after it has been fertilized by a male sperm. The Missouri Act defines \\\\\\\"conception\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male,\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.015(3) (1986), and invests \\\\\\\"unborn children\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\"protectable interests in life, health, and well-being,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(2), from \\\\\\\"the moment of conception . . . .\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.3. JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that any possible interference with a woman's right to use such postfertilization contraceptive devices would be unconstitutional under <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), and our subsequent contraception cases. <i>Post,</i> at 564-566. Similarly, certain <i>amici</i> suggest that the Missouri Act's preamble may prohibit the developing technology of <i>in vitro</i> fertilization, a technique used to aid couples otherwise unable to bear children in which a number of ova are removed from the woman and fertilized by male sperm. This process often produces excess fertilized ova (\\\\\\\"unborn children\\\\\\\" under the Missouri Act's definition) that are discarded rather than reinserted into the woman's uterus. Brief for Association of Reproductive Health Professionals <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*523</span> et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 38. It may be correct that the use of postfertilization contraceptive devices is constitutionally protected by <i>Griswold</i> and its progeny, but, as with a woman's abortion decision, nothing in the record or the opinions below indicates that the preamble will affect a woman's decision to practice contraception. For that matter, nothing in appellees' original complaint, App. 8-21, or their motion <i>in limine</i> to limit testimony and evidence on their challenge to the preamble, <i>id.,</i> at 57-59, indicates that appellees sought to enjoin potential violations of <i>Griswold.</i> Neither is there any indication of the possibility that the preamble might be applied to prohibit the performance of <i>in vitro</i> fertilization. I agree with the Court, therefore, that all of these intimations of unconstitutionality are simply too hypothetical to support the use of declaratory judgment procedures and injunctive remedies in this case.</p>\\\\n<p>Similarly, it seems to me to follow directly from our previous decisions concerning state or federal funding of abortions, <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297 (1980), <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), and <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519 (1977), that appellees' facial challenge to the constitutionality of Missouri's ban on the utilization of public facilities and the participation of public employees in the performance of abortions not necessary to save the life of the mother, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.210, 188.215 (1986), cannot succeed. Given Missouri's definition of \\\\\\\"public facility\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"any public institution, public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200(2), there may be conceivable applications of the ban on the use of public facilities that would be unconstitutional. Appellees and <i>amici</i> suggest that the State could try to enforce the ban against private hospitals using public water and sewage lines, or against private hospitals leasing state-owned equipment or state land. See Brief for Appellees 49-50; Brief for National Association of Public Hospitals as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*524</span> 9-12. Whether some or all of these or other applications of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.215 would be constitutional need not be decided here. <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>McRae</i> stand for the proposition that some quite straightforward applications of the Missouri ban on the use of public facilities for performing abortions would be constitutional and that is enough to defeat appellees' assertion that the ban is facially unconstitutional. \\\\\\\"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that the [relevant statute] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment.\\\\\\\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Salerno,</i> 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987).</p>\\\\n<p>I also agree with the Court that, under the interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 urged by the State and adopted by the Court, there is no longer a case or controversy before us over the constitutionality of that provision. I would note, however, that this interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 is not binding on the Supreme Court of Missouri which has the final word on the meaning of that State's statutes. <i>Virginia</i> v. <i>American Booksellers Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U. S. 383, 395 (1988); <i>O'Brien</i> v. <i>Skinner,</i> 414 U. S. 524, 531 (1974). Should it happen that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205, as ultimately interpreted by the Missouri Supreme Court, does prohibit publicly employed health professionals from giving specific medical advice to pregnant women, \\\\\\\"the vacation and dismissal of the complaint that has become moot `clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties,' should subsequent events rekindle their controversy.\\\\\\\" <i>Deakins</i> v. <i>Monaghan,</i> 484 U. S. 193, 201, n. 5 (1988), quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Munsingwear, Inc.,</i> 340 U. S. 36, 40 (1950). Unless such events make their appearance and give rise to relitigation, I agree that we and all federal <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*525</span> courts are without jurisdiction to hear the merits of this moot dispute.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>In its interpretation of Missouri's \\\\\\\"determination of viability\\\\\\\" provision, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 (1986), see <i>ante,</i> at 513-521, the plurality has proceeded in a manner unnecessary to deciding the question at hand. I agree with the plurality that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to interpret the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 as meaning that \\\\\\\"doctors <i>must</i> perform tests to find gestational age, fetal weight and lung maturity.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d 1071, 1075, n. 5 (CA8 1988) (emphasis in original). When read together with the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 \\u00c2\\u2014 which requires a physician to \\\\\\\"determine if the unborn child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill, and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinary skillful, careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the same or similar conditions\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u2014 it would be contradictory nonsense to read the second sentence as requiring a physician to perform viability examinations and tests in situations where it would be careless and imprudent to do so. The plurality is quite correct: \\\\\\\"the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful to making subsidiary findings as to viability,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 514, and, I would add, only those examinations and tests that it would not be imprudent or careless to perform in the particular medical situation before the physician.</p>\\\\n<p>Unlike the plurality, I do not understand these viability testing requirements to conflict with any of the Court's past decisions concerning state regulation of abortion. Therefore, there is no necessity to accept the State's invitation to reexamine the constitutional validity of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Where there is no need to decide a constitutional question, it is a venerable principle of this Court's adjudicatory processes not to do so, for \\\\\\\"[t]he Court will not `anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*526</span> necessity of deciding it.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ashwander</i> v. <i>TVA,</i> 297 U. S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), quoting <i>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co.</i> v. <i>Commissioners of Emigration,</i> 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885). Neither will it generally \\\\\\\"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\\\\\\\" 297 U. S., at 347. Quite simply, \\\\\\\"[i]t is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.\\\\\\\" <i>Burton</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905). The Court today has accepted the State's every interpretation of its abortion statute and has upheld, under our existing precedents, every provision of that statute which is properly before us. Precisely for this reason reconsideration of <i>Roe</i> falls not into any \\\\\\\"good-cause exception\\\\\\\" to this \\\\\\\"fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . .\\\\\\\" <i>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation</i> v. <i>Wold Engineering, P. C.,</i> 467 U. S. 138, 157 (1984). See <i>post,</i> at 532-533 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns on the constitutional validity of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> there will be time enough to reexamine <i>Roe.</i> And to do so carefully.</p>\\\\n<p>In assessing \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 it is especially important to recognize that appellees did not appeal the District Court's ruling that the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is constitutional. 662 F. Supp. 407, 420-422 (WD Mo. 1987). There is, accordingly, no dispute between the parties before us over the constitutionality of the \\\\\\\"presumption of viability at 20 weeks,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 515, created by the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029. If anything might arguably conflict with the Court's previous decisions concerning the determination of viability, I would think it is the introduction of this presumption. The plurality, see <i>ante,</i> at 515, refers to a passage from <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 64 (1976): \\\\\\\"The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*527</span> be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.\\\\\\\" The 20-week presumption of viability in the first sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, it could be argued (though, I would think, unsuccessfully), restricts \\\\\\\"the judgment of the responsible attending physician,\\\\\\\" by imposing on that physician the burden of overcoming the presumption. This presumption may be a \\\\\\\"superimpos[ition] [of] state regulation on the medical determination whether a particular fetus is viable,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 517, but, if so, it is a restriction on the physician's judgment that is not before us. As the plurality properly interprets the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, it does nothing more than delineate means by which the unchallenged 20-week presumption of viability may be overcome if those means are useful in doing so and can be prudently employed. Contrary to the plurality's suggestion, see <i>ante,</i> at 517, the District Court did not think the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 unconstitutional for this reason. Rather, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals thought the second sentence to be unconstitutional precisely because they interpreted that sentence to impose state regulation on the determination of viability that it does not impose.</p>\\\\n<p>Appellees suggest that the interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 urged by the State may \\\\\\\"virtually eliminat[e] the constitutional issue in this case.\\\\\\\" Brief for Appellees 30. Appellees therefore propose that we should abstain from deciding that provision's constitutionality \\\\\\\"in order to allow the state courts to render the saving construction the State has proposed.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.</i> Where the lower court has so clearly fallen into error I do not think abstention is necessary or prudent. Accordingly, I consider the constitutionality of the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, as interpreted by the State, to determine whether the constitutional issue is actually eliminated.</p>\\\\n<p>I do not think the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, as interpreted by the Court, imposes a degree of state regulation on the medical determination of viability that in any way conflicts with prior decisions of this Court. As the plurality <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*528</span> recognizes, the requirement that, where not imprudent, physicians perform examinations and tests useful to making subsidiary findings to determine viability \\\\\\\"promot[es] the State's interest in potential human life rather than in maternal health.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 515. No decision of this Court has held that the State may not directly promote its interest in potential life when viability is possible. Quite the contrary. In <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747 (1986), the Court considered a constitutional challenge to a Pennsylvania statute requiring that a second physician be present during an abortion performed \\\\\\\"when viability is possible.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 769-770. For guidance, the Court looked to the earlier decision in <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983), upholding a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a second physician during an abortion performed after viability. <i>Id.,</i> at 482-486 (opinion of Powell, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 505 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The <i>Thornburgh</i> majority struck down the Pennsylvania statute merely because the statute had no exception for emergency situations and not because it found a constitutional difference between the State's promotion of its interest in potential life when viability is possible and when viability is certain. 476 U. S., at 770-771. Despite the clear recognition by the <i>Thornburgh</i> majority that the Pennsylvania and Missouri statutes differed in this respect, there is no hint in the opinion of the <i>Thornburgh</i> Court that the State's interest in potential life differs depending on whether it seeks to further that interest postviability or when viability is possible. Thus, all nine Members of the <i>Thornburgh</i> Court appear to have agreed that it is not constitutionally impermissible for the State to enact regulations designed to protect the State's interest in potential life when viability is possible. See <i>id.,</i> at 811 (WHITE, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 832 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). That is exactly what Missouri has done in \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*529</span> Similarly, the basis for reliance by the District Court and the Court of Appeals below on <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379 (1979), disappears when \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is properly interpreted. In <i>Colautti,</i> the Court observed:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Because this point [of viability] may differ with each pregnancy, neither the legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering into the ascertainment of viability \\u00c2\\u2014 be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor \\u00c2\\u2014 as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus. Viability is the critical point.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 388-389.</blockquote>\\\\n<p>The courts below, on the interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 rejected here, found the second sentence of that provision at odds with this passage from <i>Colautti.</i> See 851 F. 2d, at 1074; 662 F. Supp., at 423. On this Court's interpretation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 it is clear that Missouri has not substituted any of the \\\\\\\"elements entering into the ascertainment of viability\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\\\\\\" All the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 does is to require, when not imprudent, the performance of \\\\\\\"those tests that are useful to making <i>subsidiary</i> findings as to viability.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 514 (emphasis added). Thus, consistent with <i>Colautti,</i> viability remains the \\\\\\\"critical point\\\\\\\" under \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029.</p>\\\\n<p>Finally, and rather halfheartedly, the plurality suggests that the marginal increase in the cost of an abortion created by Missouri's viability testing provision may make \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, even as interpreted, suspect under this Court's decision in <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 434-439 (1983), striking down a second-trimester hospitalization requirement. See <i>ante,</i> at 517. I dissented from the Court's opinion in <i>Akron</i> because it was my view that, even apart from <i>Roe</i>'s trimester framework which I continue to consider problematic, see <i>Thornburgh, supra,</i> at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*530</span> 828 (dissenting opinion), the <i>Akron</i> majority had distorted and misapplied its own standard for evaluating state regulation of abortion which the Court had applied with fair consistency in the past: that, previability, \\\\\\\"a regulation imposed on a lawful abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion.\\\\\\\" <i>Akron, supra,</i> at 453 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\\\\n<p>It is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinations and tests useful to determining whether a fetus is viable, when viability is possible, and when it would not be medically imprudent to do so, does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision. On this ground alone I would reject the suggestion that \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 as interpreted is unconstitutional. More to the point, however, just as I see no conflict between \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 and <i>Colautti</i> or any decision of this Court concerning a State's ability to give effect to its interest in potential life, I see no conflict between \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 and the Court's opinion in <i>Akron.</i> The second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down in <i>Akron</i> imposed, in the majority's view, \\\\\\\"a heavy, and unnecessary, burden,\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 438, more than doubling the cost of \\\\\\\"women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>id.,</i> at 434. By contrast, the cost of examinations and tests that could usefully and prudently be performed when a woman is 20-24 weeks pregnant to determine whether the fetus is viable would only marginally, if at all, increase the cost of an abortion. See Brief for American Association of Prolife Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 3 (\\\\\\\"At twenty weeks gestation, an ultrasound examination to determine gestational age is standard medical practice. It is routinely provided by the plaintiff clinics. An ultrasound examination can effectively provide all three designated findings of sec. 188.029\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 22 (\\\\\\\"A finding of fetal weight can be obtained from the same ultrasound test used to determine gestational age\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 25 (\\\\\\\"There are a number of different <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*531</span> methods in standard medical practice to determine fetal lung maturity at twenty or more weeks gestation. The most simple and most obvious is by inference. It is well known that fetal lungs do not mature until 33-34 weeks gestation. . . . If an assessment of the gestational age indicates that the child is less than thirty-three weeks, a general finding can be made that the fetal lungs are not mature. This finding can then be used by the physician in making his determination of viability under section 188.029\\\\\\\"); cf. Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 42 (no suggestion that fetal weight and gestational age cannot be determined from the same sonogram); <i>id.,</i> at 43 (another clinical test for gestational age and, by inference, fetal weight and lung maturity, is an accurate report of the last menstrual period), citing Smith, Frey, &amp; Johnson, Assessing Gestational Age, 33 Am. Fam. Physician 215, 219-220 (1986).</p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, the examinations and tests required by \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 are to be performed when viability is possible. This feature of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 distinguishes it from the second-trimester hospitalization requirement struck down by the <i>Akron</i> majority. As the Court recognized in <i>Thornburgh,</i> the State's compelling interest in potential life postviability renders its interest in determining the critical point of viability equally compelling. See <i>supra,</i> at 527-528. Under the Court's precedents, the same cannot be said for the <i>Akron</i> second-trimester hospitalization requirement. As I understand the Court's opinion in <i>Akron,</i> therefore, the plurality's suggestion today that <i>Akron</i> casts doubt on the validity of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, even as the Court has interpreted it, is without foundation and cannot provide a basis for reevaluating <i>Roe.</i> Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, and because, properly interpreted, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is not inconsistent with any of this Court's prior precedents, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\\\\n<p>In sum, I concur in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment as to Part II-D.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*532</span> JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\\\\n<p>I join Parts I, II-A, II-B, and II-C of the opinion of the Court. As to Part II-D, I share JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S view, <i>post,</i> at 556, that it effectively would overrule <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973). I think that should be done, but would do it more explicitly. Since today we contrive to avoid doing it, and indeed to avoid almost any decision of national import, I need not set forth my reasons, some of which have been well recited in dissents of my colleagues in other cases. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747, 786-797 (1986) (WHITE, J., dissenting); <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 453-459 (1983) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting); <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade, supra,</i> at 172-178 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 221-223 (1973) (WHITE, J., dissenting).</p>\\\\n<p>The outcome of today's case will doubtless be heralded as a triumph of judicial statesmanship. It is not that, unless it is statesmanlike needlessly to prolong this Court's self-awarded sovereignty over a field where it has little proper business since the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are political and not juridical \\u00c2\\u2014 a sovereignty which therefore quite properly, but to the great damage of the Court, makes it the object of the sort of organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy ought to receive.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S assertion, <i>ante,</i> at 526, that a \\\\\\\" `fundamental rule of judicial restraint' \\\\\\\" requires us to avoid reconsidering <i>Roe,</i> cannot be taken seriously. By finessing <i>Roe</i> we do not, as she suggests, <i>ibid.,</i> adhere to the strict and venerable rule that we should avoid \\\\\\\" `decid[ing] questions of a constitutional nature.' \\\\\\\" We have not disposed of this case on some statutory or procedural ground, but have decided, and could not avoid deciding, whether the Missouri statute meets the requirements of the United States Constitution. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*533</span> The only choice available is whether, in deciding that constitutional question, we should use <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> as the benchmark, or something else. What is involved, therefore, is not the rule of avoiding constitutional issues where possible, but the quite separate principle that we will not \\\\\\\" `formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 526. The latter is a sound general principle, but one often departed from when good reason exists. Just this Term, for example, in an opinion authored by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, despite the fact that we had already held a racially based set-aside unconstitutional because unsupported by evidence of identified discrimination, which was all that was needed to decide the case, we went on to outline the criteria for properly tailoring race-based remedies in cases where such evidence is present. <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U. S. 469, 506-508 (1989). Also this Term, in an opinion joined by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, we announced the constitutional rule that deprivation of the right to confer with counsel during trial violates the Sixth Amendment even if no prejudice can be shown, despite our finding that there had been no such deprivation on the facts before us \\u00c2\\u2014 which was all that was needed to decide that case. <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Leeke,</i> 488 U. S. 272, 278-280 (1989); see <i>id.,</i> at 285 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part). I have not identified with certainty the first instance of our deciding a case on broader constitutional grounds than absolutely necessary, but it is assuredly no later than <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137 (1803), where we held that mandamus could constitutionally issue against the Secretary of State, although that was unnecessary given our holding that the law authorizing issuance of the mandamus by this Court was unconstitutional.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court has often spoken more broadly than needed in precisely the fashion at issue here, announcing a new rule of constitutional law when it could have reached the identical result by applying the rule thereby displaced. To describe <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*534</span> two recent opinions that JUSTICE O'CONNOR joined: In <i>Daniels</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 474 U. S. 327 (1986), we overruled our prior holding that a \\\\\\\"deprivation\\\\\\\" of liberty or property could occur through negligent governmental acts, ignoring the availability of the alternative constitutional ground that, even if a deprivation had occurred, the State's postdeprivation remedies satisfied due process, see <i>id.,</i> at 340-343 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). In <i>Illinois</i> v. <i>Gates,</i> 462 U. S. 213 (1983), we replaced the pre-existing \\\\\\\"two-pronged\\\\\\\" constitutional test for probable cause with a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, ignoring the concurrence's argument that the same outcome could have been reached under the old test, see <i>id.,</i> at 267-272 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). It is rare, of course, that the Court goes out of its way to <i>acknowledge</i> that its judgment could have been reached under the old constitutional rule, making its adoption of the new one unnecessary to the decision, but even such explicit acknowledgment is not unheard of. See <i>Commonwealth Edison Co.</i> v. <i>Montana,</i> 453 U. S. 609 (1981); <i>Perez</i> v. <i>Campbell,</i> 402 U. S. 637 (1971). For a sampling of other cases where the availability of a narrower, well-established ground is simply ignored in the Court's opinion adopting a new constitutional rule, though pointed out in separate opinions of some Justices, see <i>Michelin Tire Corp.</i> v. <i>Wages,</i> 423 U. S. 276 (1976); <i>Pointer</i> v. <i>Texas,</i> 380 U. S. 400 (1965); and <i>Mapp</i> v. <i>Ohio,</i> 367 U. S. 643 (1961). It would be wrong, in any decision, to ignore the reality that our policy not to \\\\\\\"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts\\\\\\\" has a frequently applied good-cause exception. But it seems particularly perverse to convert the policy into an absolute in the present case, in order to place beyond reach the inexpressibly \\\\\\\"broader-than-was-required-by-the-precise-facts\\\\\\\" structure established by <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i></p>\\\\n<p>The real question, then, is whether there are valid reasons to go beyond the most stingy possible holding today. It seems to me there are not only valid but compelling ones. <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*535</span> Ordinarily, speaking no more broadly than is absolutely required avoids throwing settled law into confusion; doing so today preserves a chaos that is evident to anyone who can read and count. Alone sufficient to justify a broad holding is the fact that our retaining control, through <i>Roe,</i> of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize to be, a political issue, continuously distorts the public perception of the role of this Court. We can now look forward to at least another Term with carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of demonstrators, urging us \\u00c2\\u2014 their unelected and life-tenured judges who have been awarded those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will \\u00c2\\u2014 to follow the popular will. Indeed, I expect we can look forward to even more of that than before, given our indecisive decision today. And if these reasons for taking the unexceptional course of reaching a broader holding are not enough, then consider the nature of the constitutional question we avoid: In most cases, we do no harm by not speaking more broadly than the decision requires. Anyone affected by the conduct that the avoided holding would have prohibited will be able to challenge it himself and have his day in court to make the argument. Not so with respect to the harm that many States believed, pre-<i>Roe,</i> and many may continue to believe, is caused by largely unrestricted abortion. That will continue to occur if the States have the constitutional power to prohibit it, and would do so, but we skillfully avoid telling them so. Perhaps those abortions cannot constitutionally be proscribed. That is surely an arguable question, the question that reconsideration of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i> entails. But what is not at all arguable, it seems to me, is that we should decide now and not insist that we be run into a corner before we grudgingly yield up our judgment. The only sound reason for the latter course is to prevent a change in the law \\u00c2\\u2014 but to think that desirable begs the question to be decided.</p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*536</span> It was an arguable question today whether \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 of the Missouri law contravened this Court's understanding of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i><sup>[*]</sup> and I would have examined <i>Roe</i> rather than <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*537</span> examining the contravention. Given the Court's newly contracted abstemiousness, what will it take, one must wonder, to permit us to reach that fundamental question? The result of our vote today is that we will not reconsider that prior opinion, even if most of the Justices think it is wrong, unless we have before us a statute that in fact contradicts it \\u00c2\\u2014 and even then (under our newly discovered \\\\\\\"no-broader-than-necessary\\\\\\\" requirement) only minor problematical aspects of <i>Roe</i> will be reconsidered, unless one expects state legislatures to adopt provisions whose compliance with <i>Roe</i> cannot even be argued with a straight face. It thus appears that the mansion of constitutionalized abortion law, constructed overnight in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>,</i> must be disassembled doorjamb by doorjamb, and never entirely brought down, no matter how wrong it may be.</p>\\\\n<p>Of the four courses we might have chosen today \\u00c2\\u2014 to reaffirm <i>Roe,</i> to overrule it explicitly, to overrule it <i>sub silentio,</i> or to avoid the question \\u00c2\\u2014 the last is the least responsible. On the question of the constitutionality of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, I concur in the judgment of the Court and strongly dissent from the manner in which it has been reached.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE O'CONNOR would nevertheless uphold the law because it \\\\\\\"does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 530. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the required tests impose only a marginal cost on the abortion procedure, far less of an increase than the cost-doubling hospitalization requirement invalidated in <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983). See <i>ante,</i> at 530-531. The fact that the challenged regulation is less costly than what we struck down in <i>Akron</i> tells us only that we cannot decide the present case on the basis of that earlier decision. It does not tell us whether the present requirement is an \\\\\\\"undue burden,\\\\\\\" and I know of no basis for determining that this particular burden (or any other for that matter) is \\\\\\\"due.\\\\\\\" One could with equal justification conclude that it is not. To avoid the question of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>'s validity, with the attendant costs that this will have for the Court and for the principles of self-governance, on the basis of a standard that offers \\\\\\\"no guide but the Court's own discretion,\\\\\\\" <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>Missouri,</i> 281 U. S. 586, 595 (1930) (Holmes, J., dissenting), merely adds to the irrationality of what we do today.</p>\\\\n<p>Similarly irrational is the new concept that JUSTICE O'CONNOR introduces into the law in order to achieve her result, the notion of a State's \\\\\\\"interest in potential life when viability is possible.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 528. Since \\\\\\\"viability\\\\\\\" means the mere <i>possibility</i> (not the certainty) of survivability outside the womb, \\\\\\\"possible viability\\\\\\\" must mean the possibility of a possibility of survivability outside the womb. Perhaps our next opinion will expand the third trimester into the second even further, by approving state action designed to take account of \\\\\\\"the chance of possible viability.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>Today, <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and the fundamental constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, survive but are not secure. Although the Court extricates itself from this case without making a single, even incremental, change in the law of abortion, the plurality and JUSTICE SCALIA would overrule <i>Roe</i> (the first silently, the other explicitly) and would return to the States <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*538</span> virtually unfettered authority to control the quintessentially intimate, personal, and life-directing decision whether to carry a fetus to term. Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and the decisions of this Court prohibit a State from enacting laws that inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, a plurality of this Court implicitly invites every state legislature to enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases, in the hope that sometime down the line the Court will return the law of procreative freedom to the severe limitations that generally prevailed in this country before January 22, 1973. Never in my memory has a plurality announced a judgment of this Court that so foments disregard for the law and for our standing decisions.</p>\\\\n<p>Nor in my memory has a plurality gone about its business in such a deceptive fashion. At every level of its review, from its effort to read the real meaning out of the Missouri statute, to its intended evisceration of precedents and its deafening silence about the constitutional protections that it would jettison, the plurality obscures the portent of its analysis. With feigned restraint, the plurality announces that its analysis leaves <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"undisturbed,\\\\\\\" albeit \\\\\\\"modif[ied] and narrow[ed].\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 521. But this disclaimer is totally meaningless. The plurality opinion is filled with winks, and nods, and knowing glances to those who would do away with <i>Roe</i> explicitly, but turns a stone face to anyone in search of what the plurality conceives as the scope of a woman's right under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy free from the coercive and brooding influence of the State. The simple truth is that <i>Roe</i> would not survive the plurality's analysis, and that the plurality provides no substitute for <i>Roe</i>'s protective umbrella.</p>\\\\n<p>I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age in the 16 years since <i>Roe</i> was decided. I fear for the integrity of, and public esteem for, this Court.</p>\\\\n<p>I dissent.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*539</span> I</h2>\\\\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE parades through the four challenged sections of the Missouri statute <i>seriatim.</i> I shall not do this, but shall relegate most of my comments as to those sections to the margin.<sup>[1]</sup> Although I disagree with the Court's consideration <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*540</span> of \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205, 188.210, and 188.215, and am especially disturbed by its misapplication of our past decisions in upholding Missouri's ban on the performance of abortions at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*541</span> \\\\\\\"public facilities,\\\\\\\" its discussion of these provisions is merely prologue to the plurality's consideration of the statute's viability-testing requirement, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 \\u00c2\\u2014 the only section of the Missouri statute that the plurality construes as implicating <i>Roe</i> itself. There, tucked away at the end of its opinion, the plurality suggests a radical reversal of the law of abortion; and there, primarily, I direct my attention.</p>\\\\n<p>In the plurality's view, the viability-testing provision imposes a burden on second-trimester abortions as a way of furthering the State's interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus. Since under the <i>Roe</i> framework, the State may not fully regulate abortion in the interest of potential life (as opposed to maternal health) until the third trimester, the plurality finds it necessary, in order to save the Missouri testing provision, to throw out <i>Roe</i>'s trimester framework. <i>Ante,</i> at 518-520. In flat contradiction to <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 163, the plurality concludes that the State's interest in potential life is compelling before viability, and upholds the testing provision <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*542</span> because it \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers\\\\\\\" that state interest. <i>Ante,</i> at 519.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>A</h2>\\\\n<p>At the outset, I note that in its haste to limit abortion rights, the plurality compounds the errors of its analysis by needlessly reaching out to address constitutional questions that are not actually presented. The conflict between \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 and <i>Roe</i>'s trimester framework, which purportedly drives the plurality to reconsider our past decisions, is a contrived conflict: the product of an aggressive misreading of the viability-testing requirement and a needlessly wooden application of the <i>Roe</i> framework.</p>\\\\n<p>The plurality's reading of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is irreconcilable with the plain language of the statute and is in derogation of this Court's settled view that \\\\\\\"district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.' \\\\\\\" <i>Frisby</i> v. <i>Schultz,</i> 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988), quoting <i>Brockett</i> v. <i>Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</i> 472 U. S. 491, 499-500 (1985). Abruptly setting aside the construction of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 adopted by both the District Court and Court of Appeals as \\\\\\\"plain error,\\\\\\\" the plurality reads the viability-testing provision as requiring only that before a physician may perform an abortion on a woman whom he believes to be carrying a fetus of 20 or more weeks gestational age, the doctor must determine whether the fetus is viable and, as part of that exercise, must, to the extent feasible and consistent with sound medical practice, conduct tests necessary to make findings of gestational age, weight, and lung maturity. <i>Ante,</i> at 514-517. But the plurality's reading of the provision, according to which the statute requires the physician to perform tests only in order to determine <i>viability,</i> ignores the statutory language explicitly directing that \\\\\\\"the physician <i>shall</i> perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as are <i>necessary to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity</i> of the unborn child and <i>shall</i> enter such findings\\\\\\\" in the mother's medical record. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 (emphasis added). The <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*543</span> statute's plain language requires the physician to undertake whatever tests are necessary to determine gestational age, weight, and lung maturity, regardless of whether these tests are necessary to a finding of viability, and regardless of whether the tests subject the pregnant woman or the fetus to additional health risks or add substantially to the cost of an abortion.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Had the plurality read the statute as written, it would have had no cause to reconsider the <i>Roe</i> framework. As properly construed, the viability-testing provision does not pass constitutional muster under even a rational-basis standard, the least restrictive level of review applied by this Court. See <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U. S. 483 (1955). By mandating tests to determine fetal weight and lung maturity for every fetus thought to be more than 20 weeks gestational age, the statute requires physicians to undertake procedures, such as amniocentesis, that, in the situation presented, have no medical justification, impose significant additional health risks on both the pregnant woman and the fetus, and bear no rational relation to the State's interest in protecting fetal life.<sup>[3]</sup> As written, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is an arbitrary imposition of discomfort, risk, and expense, furthering no discernible interest except to make the procurement of an abortion as arduous and difficult as possible. Thus, were it not for <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*544</span> the plurality's tortured effort to avoid the plain import of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, it could have struck down the testing provision as patently irrational irrespective of the <i>Roe</i> framework.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The plurality eschews this straightforward resolution, in the hope of precipitating a constitutional crisis. Far from avoiding constitutional difficulty, the plurality attempts to engineer a dramatic retrenchment in our jurisprudence by exaggerating the conflict between its untenable construction of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 and the <i>Roe</i> trimester framework.</p>\\\\n<p>No one contests that under the <i>Roe</i> framework the State, in order to promote its interest in potential human life, may regulate and even proscribe nontherapeutic abortions once the fetus becomes viable. <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 164-165. If, as the plurality appears to hold, the testing provision simply requires a physician to use appropriate and medically sound tests to determine whether the fetus is actually viable when the estimated gestational age is greater than 20 weeks (and therefore within what the District Court found to be the margin of error for viability, <i>ante,</i> at 515-516), then I see little or no conflict with <i>Roe.</i><sup>[5]</sup> Nothing in <i>Roe,</i> or any of its progeny, holds that a State may not effectuate its compelling interest in the potential life of a viable fetus by seeking to ensure that no viable fetus is mistakenly aborted because of the inherent lack of precision in estimates of gestational age. A requirement that a physician make a finding of viability, one way or <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*545</span> the other, for every fetus that falls within the range of possible viability does no more than preserve the State's recognized authority. Although, as the plurality correctly points out, such a testing requirement would have the effect of imposing additional costs on second-trimester abortions where the tests indicated that the fetus was not viable, these costs would be merely incidental to, and a necessary accommodation of, the State's unquestioned right to prohibit nontherapeutic abortions after the point of viability. In short, the testing provision, as construed by the plurality, is consistent with the <i>Roe</i> framework and could be upheld effortlessly under current doctrine.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>How ironic it is, then, and disingenuous, that the plurality scolds the Court of Appeals for adopting a construction of the statute that fails to avoid constitutional difficulties. <i>Ante,</i> at <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*546</span> 514, 515. By distorting the statute, the plurality manages to avoid invalidating the testing provision on what should have been noncontroversial constitutional grounds; having done so, however, the plurality rushes headlong into a much deeper constitutional thicket, brushing past an obvious basis for upholding \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 in search of a pretext for scuttling the trimester framework. Evidently, from the plurality's perspective, the real problem with the Court of Appeals' construction of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is not that it raised a constitutional difficulty, but that it raised the wrong constitutional difficulty \\u00c2\\u2014 one not implicating <i>Roe.</i> The plurality has remedied that, traditional canons of construction and judicial forbearance notwithstanding.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>B</h2>\\\\n<p>Having set up the conflict between \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 and the <i>Roe</i> trimester framework, the plurality summarily discards <i>Roe</i>'s analytic core as \\\\\\\" `unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.' \\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 518, quoting <i>Garcia</i> v. <i>San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,</i> 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985). This is so, the plurality claims, because the key elements of the framework do not appear in the text of the Constitution, because the framework more closely resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional doctrine, and because under the framework the State's interest in potential human life is considered compelling only after viability, when, in fact, that interest is equally compelling throughout pregnancy. <i>Ante,</i> at 519-520. The plurality does not bother to explain these alleged flaws in <i>Roe.</i> Bald assertion masquerades as reasoning. The object, quite clearly, is not to persuade, but to prevail.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>1</h2>\\\\n<p>The plurality opinion is far more remarkable for the arguments that it does not advance than for those that it does. The plurality does not even mention, much less join, the true jurisprudential debate underlying this case: whether the Constitution includes an \\\\\\\"unenumerated\\\\\\\" general right to <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*547</span> privacy as recognized in many of our decisions, most notably <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), and <i>Roe,</i> and, more specifically, whether, and to what extent, such a right to privacy extends to matters of childbearing and family life, including abortion. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438 (1972) (contraception); <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967) (marriage); <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</i> 316 U. S. 535 (1942) (procreation); <i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> 268 U. S. 510 (1925) (childrearing).<sup>[7]</sup> These are questions of unsurpassed significance in this Court's interpretation of the Constitution, and mark the battleground upon which this case was fought, by the parties, by the United States as <i>amicus</i> on behalf of petitioners, and by an unprecedented number of <i>amici.</i> On these grounds, abandoned by the plurality, the Court should decide this case.</p>\\\\n<p>But rather than arguing that the text of the Constitution makes no mention of the right to privacy, the plurality complains that the critical elements of the <i>Roe</i> framework \\u00c2\\u2014 trimesters <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*548</span> and viability \\u00c2\\u2014 do not appear in the Constitution and are, therefore, somehow inconsistent with a Constitution cast in general terms. <i>Ante,</i> at 518-519. Were this a true concern, we would have to abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. As the plurality well knows, or should know, the \\\\\\\"critical elements\\\\\\\" of countless constitutional doctrines nowhere appear in the Constitution's text. The Constitution makes no mention, for example, of the First Amendment's \\\\\\\"actual malice\\\\\\\" standard for proving certain libels, see <i>New York Times Co.</i> v. <i>Sullivan,</i> 376 U. S. 254 (1964), or of the standard for determining when speech is obscene. See <i>Miller</i> v. <i>California,</i> 413 U. S. 15 (1973). Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of the rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations of intermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Court evaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause. The reason is simple. Like the <i>Roe</i> framework, these tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they are judge-made methods for evaluating and measuring the strength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the constitutional rights of individuals against the competing interests of government.</p>\\\\n<p>With respect to the <i>Roe</i> framework, the general constitutional principle, indeed the fundamental constitutional right, for which it was developed is the right to privacy, see, <i>e. g., </i><i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965), a species of \\\\\\\"liberty\\\\\\\" protected by the Due Process Clause, which under our past decisions safeguards the right of women to exercise some control over their own role in procreation. As we recently reaffirmed in <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,</i> 476 U. S. 747 (1986), few decisions are \\\\\\\"more basic to individual dignity and autonomy\\\\\\\" or more appropriate to that \\\\\\\"certain private sphere of individual liberty\\\\\\\" that the Constitution reserves from the intrusive reach of government than the right to make the uniquely personal, intimate, and self-defining decision whether to end <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*549</span> a pregnancy. <i>Id.,</i> at 772. It is this general principle, the \\\\\\\" `moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole,' \\\\\\\" <i>id.,</i> at 777, n. 5 (STEVENS, J., concurring), quoting Fried, Correspondence, 6 Phil. &amp; Pub. Aff. 288-289 (1977), that is found in the Constitution. See <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 152-153. The trimester framework simply defines and limits that right to privacy in the abortion context to accommodate, not destroy, a State's legitimate interest in protecting the health of pregnant women and in preserving potential human life. <i>Id.,</i> at 154-162. Fashioning such accommodations between individual rights and the legitimate interests of government, establishing benchmarks and standards with which to evaluate the competing claims of individuals and government, lies at the very heart of constitutional adjudication. To the extent that the trimester framework is useful in this enterprise, it is not only consistent with constitutional interpretation, but necessary to the wise and just exercise of this Court's paramount authority to define the scope of constitutional rights.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>2</h2>\\\\n<p>The plurality next alleges that the result of the trimester framework has \\\\\\\"been a web of legal rules that have become increasingly intricate, resembling a code of regulations rather than a body of constitutional doctrine.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 518. Again, if this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon vast areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. The plurality complains that under the trimester framework the Court has distinguished between a city ordinance requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed in clinics and a state law requiring that these abortions be performed in hospitals, or between laws requiring that certain information be furnished to a woman by a physician or his assistant and those requiring that such information be furnished by the physician exclusively. <i>Ante,</i> at 518, n. 15, citing <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 462 U. S. 506 (1983), <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*550</span> and <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983). Are these distinctions any finer, or more \\\\\\\"regulatory,\\\\\\\" than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we have held that a \\\\\\\"release time\\\\\\\" program permitting public-school students to leave school grounds during school hours to receive religious instruction does not violate the Establishment Clause, even though a release-time program permitting religious instruction on school grounds does violate the Clause? Compare <i>Zorach</i> v. <i>Clauson,</i> 343 U. S. 306 (1952), with <i>Illinois ex rel. McCollum</i> v. <i>Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign County,</i> 333 U. S. 203 (1948). Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes factual distinctions no less intricate. Just this Term, for example, we held that while an aerial observation from a helicopter hovering at 400 feet does not violate any reasonable expectation of privacy, such an expectation of privacy would be violated by a helicopter observation from an unusually low altitude. <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Riley,</i> 488 U. S. 445, 451 (1989) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment). Similarly, in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban on attorney-client communication violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel, <i>Geders</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 425 U. S. 80 (1976), that right was not violated when a trial judge separated a defendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recess after the defendant's direct testimony. <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Leeke,</i> 488 U. S. 272 (1989).</p>\\\\n<p>That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations between similar circumstances does not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication in favor of regulation. Rather, these careful distinctions reflect the process of constitutional adjudication itself, which is often highly fact specific, requiring such determinations as whether state laws are \\\\\\\"unduly burdensome\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"reasonable\\\\\\\" or bear a \\\\\\\"rational\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"necessary\\\\\\\" relation to asserted state interests. In a recent due process case, THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrote for the <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*551</span> Court: \\\\\\\"[M]any branches of the law abound in nice distinctions that may be troublesome but have been thought nonetheless necessary: `I do not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my view depends upon differences of degree. The whole law does so as soon as it is civilized.' \\\\\\\" <i>Daniels</i> v. <i>Williams,</i> 474 U. S. 327, 334 (1986), quoting <i>LeRoy Fibre Co.</i> v. <i>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. Co.,</i> 232 U. S. 340, 354 (1914) (Holmes, J., partially concurring).</p>\\\\n<p>These \\\\\\\"differences of degree\\\\\\\" fully account for our holdings in <i>Simopoulos, supra,</i> and <i>Akron, supra</i><i>.</i> Those decisions rest on this Court's reasoned and accurate judgment that hospitalization and doctor-counseling requirements unduly burdened the right of women to terminate a pregnancy and were not rationally related to the State's asserted interest in the health of pregnant women, while Virginia's <i>substantially less restrictive</i> regulations were not unduly burdensome and did rationally serve the State's interest.<sup>[8]</sup> That the Court exercised its best judgment in evaluating these markedly different statutory schemes no more established the Court as an \\\\\\\" `<i>ex officio</i> medical board,' \\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 519, quoting <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 99 (1976) (opinion of WHITE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), than our decisions involving religion in the public schools establish the Court as a national school board, or our decisions concerning prison regulations establish the Court as <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*552</span> a bureau of prisons. See <i>Thornburgh</i> v. <i>Abbott,</i> 490 U. S. 401 (1989) (adopting different standard of First Amendment review for incoming as opposed to outgoing prison mail). If, in delicate and complicated areas of constitutional law, our legal judgments \\\\\\\"have become increasingly intricate,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 518, it is not, as the plurality contends, because we have overstepped our judicial role. Quite the opposite: the rules are intricate because we have remained conscientious in our duty to do justice carefully, especially when fundamental rights rise or fall with our decisions.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>3</h2>\\\\n<p>Finally, the plurality asserts that the trimester framework cannot stand because the State's interest in potential life is compelling throughout pregnancy, not merely after viability. <i>Ante,</i> at 519. The opinion contains not one word of rationale for its view of the State's interest. This \\\\\\\"it-is-so-because-we-say-so\\\\\\\" jurisprudence constitutes nothing other than an attempted exercise of brute force; reason, much less persuasion, has no place.</p>\\\\n<p>In answering the plurality's claim that the State's interest in the fetus is uniform and compelling throughout pregnancy, I cannot improve upon what JUSTICE STEVENS has written:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"I should think it obvious that the State's interest in the protection of an embryo \\u00c2\\u2014 even if that interest is defined as `protecting those who will be citizens' . . . \\u00c2\\u2014 increases progressively and dramatically as the organism's capacity to feel pain, to experience pleasure, to survive, and to react to its surroundings increases day by day. The development of a fetus \\u00c2\\u2014 and pregnancy itself \\u00c2\\u2014 are not static conditions, and the assertion that the government's interest is static simply ignores this reality. . . . [U]nless the religious view that a fetus is a `person' is adopted . . . there is a fundamental and well-recognized difference between a fetus and a human being; indeed, if <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*553</span> there is not such a difference, the permissibility of terminating the life of a fetus could scarcely be left to the will of the state legislatures. And if distinctions may be drawn between a fetus and a human being in terms of the state interest in their protection \\u00c2\\u2014 even though the fetus represents one of `those who will be citizens' \\u00c2\\u2014 it seems to me quite odd to argue that distinctions may not also be drawn between the state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting the 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. Recognition of this distinction is supported not only by logic, but also by history and by our shared experiences.\\\\\\\" <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 778-779 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>See also <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 129-147.</p>\\\\n<p>For my own part, I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16 years ago were convinced, that the <i>Roe</i> framework, and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutional liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and accommodating the State's interest in potential human life. The viability line reflects the biological facts and truths of fetal development; it marks that threshold moment prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be regarded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from, or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At the same time, the viability standard takes account of the undeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postnatal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterine environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potential human life, and in fostering a regard for human life in general, becomes compelling. As a practical matter, because viability follows \\\\\\\"quickening\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u2014 the point at which a woman feels movement in her womb \\u00c2\\u2014 and because viability occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it establishes an easily applicable standard for regulating abortion while <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*554</span> providing a pregnant woman ample time to exercise her fundamental right with her responsible physician to terminate her pregnancy.<sup>[9]</sup> Although I have stated previously for a majority of this Court that \\\\\\\"[c]onstitutional rights do not always have easily ascertainable boundaries,\\\\\\\" to seek and establish those boundaries remains the special responsibility of this Court. <i>Thornburgh,</i> 476 U. S., at 771. In <i>Roe,</i> we discharged that responsibility as logic and science compelled. The plurality today advances not one reasonable argument as to why our judgment in that case was wrong and should be abandoned.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>C</h2>\\\\n<p>Having contrived an opportunity to reconsider the <i>Roe</i> framework, and then having discarded that framework, the plurality finds the testing provision unobjectionable because it \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers the State's interest in protecting potential human life.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 519-520. This newly minted <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*555</span> standard is circular and totally meaningless. Whether a challenged abortion regulation \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers\\\\\\\" a legitimate state interest is the <i>question</i> that courts must answer in abortion cases, not the standard for courts to apply. In keeping with the rest of its opinion, the plurality makes no attempt to explain or to justify its new standard, either in the abstract or as applied in this case. Nor could it. The \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers\\\\\\\" standard has no independent meaning, and consists of nothing other than what a majority of this Court may believe at any given moment in any given case. The plurality's novel test appears to be nothing more than a dressed-up version of rational-basis review, this Court's most lenient level of scrutiny. One thing is clear, however: were the plurality's \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers\\\\\\\" standard adopted by the Court, for all practical purposes, <i>Roe</i> would be overruled.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>The \\\\\\\"permissibly furthers\\\\\\\" standard completely disregards the irreducible minimum of <i>Roe:</i> the Court's recognition that a woman has a limited fundamental constitutional right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. That right receives no meaningful recognition in the plurality's written opinion. Since, in the plurality's view, the State's interest in potential life is compelling as of the moment of conception, and is therefore served only if abortion is abolished, every hindrance to a woman's ability to obtain an abortion must be \\\\\\\"permissible.\\\\\\\" Indeed, the more severe the hindrance, the more effectively (and permissibly) the State's interest would be furthered. A tax on abortions or a criminal prohibition would both satisfy the plurality's standard. So, for that <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*556</span> matter, would a requirement that a pregnant woman memorize and recite today's plurality opinion before seeking an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>The plurality pretends that <i>Roe</i> survives, explaining that the facts of this case differ from those in <i>Roe:</i> here, Missouri has chosen to assert its interest in potential life only at the point of viability, whereas, in <i>Roe,</i> Texas had asserted that interest from the point of conception, criminalizing all abortions, except where the life of the mother was at stake. <i>Ante,</i> at 521. This, of course, is a distinction without a difference. The plurality repudiates every principle for which <i>Roe</i> stands; in good conscience, it cannot possibly believe that <i>Roe</i> lies \\\\\\\"undisturbed\\\\\\\" merely because this case does not call upon the Court to reconsider the Texas statute, or one like it. If the Constitution permits a State to enact any statute that reasonably furthers its interest in potential life, and if that interest arises as of conception, why would the Texas statute fail to pass muster? One suspects that the plurality agrees. It is impossible to read the plurality opinion and especially its final paragraph, without recognizing its implicit invitation to every State to enact more and more restrictive abortion laws, and to assert their interest in potential life as of the moment of conception. All these laws will satisfy the plurality's nonscrutiny, until sometime, a new regime of old dissenters and new appointees will declare what the plurality intends: that <i>Roe</i> is no longer good law.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>\\\\n<span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*557</span> D</h2>\\\\n<p>Thus, \\\\\\\"not with a bang, but a whimper,\\\\\\\" the plurality discards a landmark case of the last generation, and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children. The plurality does so either oblivious or insensitive to the fact that millions of women, and their families, have ordered their lives around the right to reproductive choice, and that this right has become vital to the full participation of women in the economic and political walks of American life. The plurality would clear the way once again for government to force upon women the physical labor and specific and direct medical and psychological harms that may accompany carrying a fetus to term. The plurality would clear the way again for the State to conscript a woman's body and to force upon her a \\\\\\\"distressful life and future.\\\\\\\" <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 153.</p>\\\\n<p>The result, as we know from experience, see Cates &amp; Rochat, Illegal Abortions in the United States: 1972-1974, 8 Family Planning Perspectives 86, 92 (1976), would be that every year hundreds of thousands of women, in desperation, would defy the law, and place their health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of back-alley abortionists, or they would attempt to perform abortions upon themselves, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*558</span> with disastrous results. Every year, many women, especially poor and minority women, would die or suffer debilitating physical trauma, all in the name of enforced morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion, as it may be.</p>\\\\n<p>Of the aspirations and settled understandings of American women, of the inevitable and brutal consequences of what it is doing, the tough-approach plurality utters not a word. This silence is callous. It is also profoundly destructive of this Court as an institution. To overturn a constitutional decision is a rare and grave undertaking. To overturn a constitutional decision that secured a fundamental personal liberty to millions of persons would be unprecedented in our 200 years of constitutional history. Although the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> applies with somewhat diminished force in constitutional cases generally, <i>ante,</i> at 518, even in ordinary constitutional cases \\\\\\\"any departure from . . . <i>stare decisis</i> demands special justification.\\\\\\\" <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Rumsey,</i> 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984). See also <i>Vasquez</i> v. <i>Hillery,</i> 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986) (\\\\\\\"[T]he careful observer will discern that any detours from the straight path of <i>stare decisis</i> in our past have occurred for articulable reasons, and only when the Court has felt obliged `to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained,' \\\\\\\" quoting <i>Burnet</i> v. <i>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U. S. 393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). This requirement of justification applies with unique force where, as here, the Court's abrogation of precedent would destroy people's firm belief, based on past decisions of this Court, that they possess an unabridgeable right to undertake certain conduct.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\\\\n<p><span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*559</span> As discussed at perhaps too great length above, the plurality makes no serious attempt to carry \\\\\\\"the heavy burden of persuading . . . that changes in society or in the law dictate\\\\\\\" the abandonment of <i>Roe</i> and its numerous progeny, <i>Vasquez,</i> 474 U. S., at 266, much less the greater burden of explaining the abrogation of a fundamental personal freedom. Instead, the plurality pretends that it leaves <i>Roe</i> standing, and refuses even to discuss the real issue underlying this case: whether the Constitution includes an unenumerated right to privacy that encompasses a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. To the extent that the plurality does criticize the <i>Roe</i> framework, these criticisms are pure <i>ipse dixit.</i></p>\\\\n<p>This comes at a cost. The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> \\\\\\\"permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact.\\\\\\\" 474 U. S., at 265-266. Today's decision involves the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our time. By refusing to explain or to justify its proposed revolutionary revision in the law of abortion, and by refusing to abide not only by our precedents, but also by our canons for reconsidering those precedents, the plurality invites charges of cowardice and <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*560</span> illegitimacy to our door. I cannot say that these would be undeserved.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed. For today, the women of this Nation still retain the liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\\\\n<p>Having joined Part II-C of the Court's opinion, I shall not comment on \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 of the Missouri statute. With respect to the challenged portions of \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.210 and 188.215, I agree with JUSTICE BLACKMUN, <i>ante,</i> at 539-541, n. 1 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), that the record identifies a sufficient number of unconstitutional applications to support the Court of Appeals' judgment invalidating those provisions. The reasons why I would also affirm that court's invalidation of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, the viability testing provision, and \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1), (2) of the preamble,<sup>[1]</sup> require separate explanation.</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>I</h2>\\\\n<p>It seems to me that in Part II-D of its opinion, the plurality strains to place a construction on \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029<sup>[2]</sup> that enables <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*561</span> it to conclude: \\\\\\\"[W]e would modify and narrow <i>Roe</i> and succeeding cases,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 521. That statement is ill advised because there is no need to modify even slightly the holdings of prior cases in order to uphold \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029. For the most plausible nonliteral construction, as both JUSTICE BLACKMUN, <i>ante,</i> at 542-544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), and JUSTICE O'CONNOR, <i>ante,</i> at 525-531 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment), have demonstrated, is constitutional and entirely consistent with our precedents.</p>\\\\n<p>I am unable to accept JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S construction of the second sentence in \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, however, because I believe it is foreclosed by two controlling principles of statutory interpretation. First, it is our settled practice to accept \\\\\\\"the interpretation of state law in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals have concurred even if an examination of the state-law issue without such guidance might have justified a different conclusion.\\\\\\\" <i>Bishop</i> v. <i>Wood,</i> 426 U. S. 341, 346 (1976).<sup>[3]</sup> Second, \\\\\\\"[t]he fact that a particular application of the clear terms of a statute might be unconstitutional does not provide us with a justification for ignoring the plain meaning of the statute.\\\\\\\" <i>Public Citizen</i> v. <i>Department of Justice,</i> 491 U. S. 440, 481 (1989) (KENNEDY, J., concurring <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*562</span> in judgment).<sup>[4]</sup> In this case, I agree with the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d 1071, 1074-1075 (CA8 1988), and the District Court, 662 F. Supp. 407, 423 (WD Mo. 1987), that the meaning of the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is too plain to be ignored. The sentence twice uses the mandatory term \\\\\\\"shall,\\\\\\\" and contains no qualifying language. If it is implicitly limited to tests that are useful in determining viability, it adds nothing to the requirement imposed by the preceding sentence.</p>\\\\n<p>My interpretation of the plain language is supported by the structure of the statute as a whole, particularly the preamble, which \\\\\\\"finds\\\\\\\" that life \\\\\\\"begins at conception\\\\\\\" and further commands that state laws shall be construed to provide the maximum protection to \\\\\\\"the unborn child at every stage of development.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1), 1.205.2 (1986). I agree with the District Court that \\\\\\\"[o]bviously, the purpose of this law is to protect the potential life of the fetus, rather than to safeguard maternal health.\\\\\\\" 662 F. Supp., at 420. A literal reading of the statute tends to accomplish that goal. Thus it is not \\\\\\\"incongruous,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 515, to assume that the Missouri Legislature was trying to protect the potential human life of nonviable fetuses by making the abortion decision more costly.<sup>[5]</sup> On the contrary, I am satisfied that the Court of Appeals, as well as the District Court, correctly concluded that the Missouri Legislature meant exactly what it said in the second sentence of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029. I am also satisfied, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*563</span> for the reasons stated by JUSTICE BLACKMUN, that the testing provision is manifestly unconstitutional under <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical Co.,</i> 348 U. S. 483 (1955), \\\\\\\"irrespective of the <i>Roe</i> [v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973),] framework.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 544 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>II</h2>\\\\n<p>The Missouri statute defines \\\\\\\"conception\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male,\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.015(3) (1986), even though standard medical texts equate \\\\\\\"conception\\\\\\\" with implantation in the uterus, occurring about six days after fertilization.<sup>[6]</sup> Missouri's declaration therefore implies regulation not only of previability abortions, but also of common forms of contraception such as the IUD and the morning-after pill.<sup>[7]</sup> Because the preamble, read in context, threatens serious encroachments upon the liberty of the pregnant woman and the health professional, I am persuaded that these plaintiffs, appellees before us, have <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*564</span> standing to challenge its constitutionality. Accord, 851 F. 2d, at 1075-1076.</p>\\\\n<p>To the extent that the Missouri statute interferes with contraceptive choices, I have no doubt that it is unconstitutional under the Court's holdings in <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479 (1965); <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438 (1972); and <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Population Services International,</i> 431 U. S. 678 (1977). The place of <i>Griswold</i> in the mosaic of decisions defining a woman's liberty interest was accurately stated by Justice Stewart in his concurring opinion in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 167-170 (1973):</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"[I]n <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut,</i> 381 U. S. 479, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in [<i>Ferguson</i> v.] <i>Skrupa,</i> [372 U. S. 726 (1963),] the Court's opinion in <i>Griswold</i> understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet, the Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific provision of the Constitution. So it was clear to me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the <i>Griswold</i> decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the `liberty' that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As so understood, <i>Griswold</i> stands as one in a long line of pre-<i>Skrupa</i> cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such.</blockquote>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>.....</h2>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1, 12 [(1967)]; <i>Griswold</i> v. <i>Connecticut, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Pierce</i> v. <i>Society of Sisters,</i> [268 U. S. 510 (1925)]; <i>Meyer</i> v. <i>Nebraska,</i> [262 U. S. 390 (1923)]. See also <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*565</span> <i>Prince</i> v. <i>Massachusetts,</i> 321 U. S. 158, 166 [(1944)]; <i>Skinner</i> v. <i>Oklahoma,</i> 316 U. S. 535, 541 [(1942)]. As recently as last Term, in <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 405 U. S. 438, 453 [(1972)], we recognized `the right of the <i>individual,</i> married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. `Certainly the interests of a woman in giving of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a child are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy than the right to send a child to private school protected in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), or the right to teach a foreign language protected in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923).' <i>Abele</i> v. <i>Markle,</i> 351 F. Supp. 224, 227 (Conn. 1972).</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\\\\\\" (Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.)<sup>[8]</sup></blockquote>\\\\n<p>One might argue that the <i>Griswold</i> holding applies to devices \\\\\\\"preventing conception,\\\\\\\" 381 U. S., at 480 \\u00c2\\u2014 that is, fertilization \\u00c2\\u2014 but not to those preventing implantation, and therefore, that <i>Griswold</i> does not protect a woman's choice to use an IUD or take a morning-after pill. There is unquestionably <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*566</span> a theological basis for such an argument,<sup>[9]</sup> just as there was unquestionably a theological basis for the Connecticut statute that the Court invalidated in <i>Griswold.</i> Our jurisprudence, however, has consistently required a secular basis for valid legislation. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Stone</i> v. <i>Graham,</i> 449 U. S. 39, 40 (1980) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i><sup>[10]</sup> Because I am not aware of any secular basis for differentiating between contraceptive procedures that are effective immediately before and those that are effective immediately after fertilization, I believe it inescapably follows that the preamble to the Missouri statute is invalid under <i>Griswold</i> and its progeny.</p>\\\\n<p>Indeed, I am persuaded that the absence of any secular purpose for the legislative declarations that life begins at conception and that conception occurs at fertilization makes the relevant portion of the preamble invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution. This conclusion does not, and could not, rest on the fact that the statement happens to coincide with the tenets of certain religions, see <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland,</i> 366 U. S. 420, 442 (1961); <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 319-320 (1980), or on the fact that the legislators who voted to enact it may have been motivated by religious considerations, see <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Davis,</i> 426 U. S. 229, 253 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring). Rather, it rests on the fact that the preamble, an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet of some but by no means all Christian faiths,<sup>[11]</sup> serves no identifiable <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*567</span> secular purpose. That fact alone compels a conclusion that the statute violates the Establishment Clause.<sup>[12]</sup><i>Wallace</i> v. <i>Jaffree,</i> 472 U. S. 38, 56 (1985).</p>\\\\n<p>My concern can best be explained by reference to the position on this issue that was widely accepted by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church for many years. The position is summarized in a report, entitled \\\\\\\"Catholic Teaching On Abortion,\\\\\\\" prepared by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. It states in part:</p>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"The disagreement over the status of the unformed as against the formed fetus was crucial for Christian teaching on the soul. It was widely held that the soul was not present until the formation of the fetus 40 or 80 days after conception, for males and females respectively. Thus, abortion of the `unformed' or `inanimate' fetus (from <i>anima,</i> soul) was something less than true homicide, rather a form of anticipatory or quasi-homicide. This view received its definitive treatment in St. Thomas Aquinas and became for a time the dominant interpretation in the Latin Church.</blockquote>\\\\n<p></p>\\\\n<h2>.....</h2>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"For St. Thomas, as for mediaeval Christendom generally, there is a lapse of time \\u00c2\\u2014 approximately 40 to 80 days \\u00c2\\u2014 after conception and before the soul's infusion. . . .</blockquote>\\\\n<blockquote>\\\\\\\"For St. Thomas, `seed and what is not seed is determined by sensation and movement.' What is destroyed in abortion of the unformed fetus is seed, not man. This distinction received its most careful analysis in St. Thomas. It was the general belief of Christendom, reflected, <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*568</span> for example, in the Council of Trent (1545-1563), which restricted penalties for homicide to abortion of an animated fetus only.\\\\\\\" C. Whittier, Catholic Teaching on Abortion: Its Origin and Later Development (1981), reprinted in Brief for Americans United for Separation of Church and State as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 13a, 17a (quoting <i>In octo libros politicorum</i> 7.12, attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas).</blockquote>\\\\n<p>If the views of St. Thomas were held as widely today as they were in the Middle Ages, and if a state legislature were to enact a statute prefaced with a \\\\\\\"finding\\\\\\\" that female life begins 80 days after conception and male life begins 40 days after conception, I have no doubt that this Court would promptly conclude that such an endorsement of a particular religious tenet is violative of the Establishment Clause.</p>\\\\n<p>In my opinion the difference between that hypothetical statute and Missouri's preamble reflects nothing more than a difference in theological doctrine. The preamble to the Missouri statute endorses the theological position that there is the same secular interest in preserving the life of a fetus during the first 40 or 80 days of pregnancy as there is after viability \\u00c2\\u2014 indeed, after the time when the fetus has become a \\\\\\\"person\\\\\\\" with legal rights protected by the Constitution.<sup>[13]</sup> To sustain that position as a matter of law, I believe Missouri has the burden of identifying the secular interests that differentiate the first 40 days of pregnancy from the period immediately <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*569</span> before or after fertilization when, as <i>Griswold</i> and related cases establish, the Constitution allows the use of contraceptive procedures to prevent potential life from developing into full personhood. Focusing our attention on the first several weeks of pregnancy is especially appropriate because that is the period when the vast majority of abortions are actually performed.</p>\\\\n<p>As a secular matter, there is an obvious difference between the state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the state interest in protecting a 9-month-gestated, fully sentient fetus on the eve of birth. There can be no interest in protecting the newly fertilized egg from physical pain or mental anguish, because the capacity for such suffering does not yet exist; respecting a developed fetus, however, that interest is valid. In fact, if one prescinds the theological concept of ensoulment \\u00c2\\u2014 or one accepts St. Thomas Aquinas' view that ensoulment does not occur for at least 40 days \\u00c2\\u2014 a State has no greater secular interest in protecting the potential life of an embryo that is still \\\\\\\"seed\\\\\\\" than in protecting the potential life of a sperm or an unfertilized ovum.</p>\\\\n<p>There have been times in history when military and economic interests would have been served by an increase in population. No one argues today, however, that Missouri can assert a societal interest in increasing its population as its secular reason for fostering potential life. Indeed, our national policy, as reflected in legislation the Court upheld last Term, is to prevent the potential life that is produced by \\\\\\\"pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried adolescents.\\\\\\\" <i>Bowen</i> v. <i>Kendrick,</i> 487 U. S. 589, 593 (1988); accord, <i>id.,</i> at 602. If the secular analysis were based on a strict balancing of fiscal costs and benefits, the economic costs of unlimited childbearing would outweigh those of abortion. There is, of course, an important and unquestionably valid secular interest in \\\\\\\"protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an incorrect decision,\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 102 (1976) <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*570</span> (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Although that interest is served by a requirement that the woman receive medical and, in appropriate circumstances, parental, advice,<sup>[14]</sup> it does not justify the state legislature's official endorsement of the theological tenet embodied in \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1), (2).</p>\\\\n<p>The State's suggestion that the \\\\\\\"finding\\\\\\\" in the preamble to its abortion statute is, in effect, an amendment to its tort, property, and criminal laws is not persuasive. The Court of Appeals concluded that the preamble \\\\\\\"is simply an impermissible state adoption of a theory of when life begins to justify its abortion regulations.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1076. Supporting that construction is the state constitutional prohibition against legislative enactments pertaining to more than one subject matter. Mo. Const., Art. 3, \\u00c2\\u00a7 23. See <i>In re Ray,</i> 83 B. R. 670 (Bkrtcy Ct., ED Mo. 1988); <i>Berry</i> v. <i>Majestic Milling Co.,</i> 223 S. W. 738 (Mo. 1920). Moreover, none of the tort, property, or criminal law cases cited by the State was either based on or buttressed by a theological answer to the question of when life begins. Rather, the Missouri courts, as well as a number of other state courts, had already concluded that a \\\\\\\"fetus is a `person,' `minor,' or `minor child' within the meaning of their particular wrongful death statutes.\\\\\\\" <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*571</span> <i>O'Grady</i> v. <i>Brown,</i> 654 S. W. 2d 904, 910 (Mo. 1983) (en banc).<sup>[15]</sup></p>\\\\n<p>Bolstering my conclusion that the preamble violates the First Amendment is the fact that the intensely divisive character of much of the national debate over the abortion issue reflects the deeply held religious convictions of many participants in the debate.<sup>[16]</sup> The Missouri Legislature may not inject its endorsement of a particular religious tradition into this debate, for \\\\\\\"[t]he Establishment Clause does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement.\\\\\\\" See <i>County of Allegheny</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, post,</i> at 651 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>In my opinion the preamble to the Missouri statute is unconstitutional for two reasons. To the extent that it has substantive impact on the freedom to use contraceptive procedures, it is inconsistent with the central holding in <i>Griswold.</i> To the extent that it merely makes \\\\\\\"legislative findings without operative effect,\\\\\\\" as the State argues, Brief for Appellants 22, it violates the Establishment Clause of the First <span class=\\\\\\\"star-pagination\\\\\\\">*572</span> Amendment. Contrary to the theological \\\\\\\"finding\\\\\\\" of the Missouri Legislature, a woman's constitutionally protected liberty encompasses the right to act on her own belief that \\u00c2\\u2014 to paraphrase St. Thomas Aquinas \\u00c2\\u2014 until a seed has acquired the powers of sensation and movement, the life of a human being has not yet begun.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\\\\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\\\\n<p>[*]  Briefs of <i>amici curiae</i> urging reversal were filed for Alabama Lawyers for Unborn Children, Inc., by <i>John J.

Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 559.100, 542.380, and 563.300 (1969), were declared unconstitutional by a three-judge federal court. This Court summarily affirmed that judgment. <i>Danforth</i> v. <i>Rodgers,</i> 414 U. S. 1035 (1973). Those statutes, like the Texas statute at issue in <i>Roe,</i> made it a crime to perform an abortion except when the mother's life was at stake. 410 U. S., at 117-118, and n. 2.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>In June 1974, the State enacted House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211, which imposed new regulations on abortions during all stages of pregnancy. Among other things, the 1974 Act defined \\\\\\\"viability,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 2(2); required the written consent of the woman prior to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3(2); required the written consent of the woman's spouse prior to an elective abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3(3); required the written consent of one parent if the woman was under 18 and unmarried prior to an elective abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, \\u00c2\\u00a7 3(4); required a physician performing an abortion to exercise professional care to \\\\\\\"preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\\\\\" regardless of the stage of pregnancy and, if he should fail that duty, deemed him guilty of manslaughter and made him liable for damages, \\u00c2\\u00a7 6(1); prohibited the use of saline amniocentesis, as a method of abortion, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, \\u00c2\\u00a7 9; and required certain record-keeping for health facilities and physicians performing abortions, \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 10, 11. In <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), the Court upheld the definition of viability, <i>id.,</i> at 63-65, the consent provision in \\u00c2\\u00a7 3(2), <i>id.,</i> at 65-67, and the recordkeeping requirements. <i>Id.,</i> at 79-81. It struck down the spousal consent provision, <i>id.,</i> at 67-72, the parental consent provision, <i>id.,</i> at 72-75, the prohibition on abortions by amniocentesis, <i>id.,</i> at 75-79, and the requirement that physicians exercise professional care to preserve the life of the fetus regardless of the stage of pregnancy. <i>Id.,</i> at 81-84.</p>\\\\n<p>In 1979, Missouri passed legislation that, <i>inter alia,</i> required abortions after 12 weeks to be performed in a hospital, Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.025 (Supp. 1979); required a pathology report for each abortion performed, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.047; required the presence of a second physician during abortions performed after viability, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.030.3; and required minors to secure parental consent or consent from the juvenile court for an abortion, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.028. In <i>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> 462 U. S. 476 (1983), the Court struck down the second-trimester hospitalization requirement, <i>id.,</i> at 481-482, but upheld the other provisions described above. <i>Id.,</i> at 494.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  The Act defines \\\\\\\"gestational age\\\\\\\" as the \\\\\\\"length of pregnancy as measured from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.015(4) (1986).</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The State did not appeal the District Court's invalidation of the Act's \\\\\\\"informed consent\\\\\\\" provision to the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d, at 1073, n. 2, and it is not before us.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  Section 1.205 provides in full:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"1. The general assembly of this state finds that:</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(1) The life of each human being begins at conception;</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(2) Unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being;</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"(3) The natural parents of unborn children have protectable interests in the life, health, and well-being of their unborn child.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"2. Effective January 1, 1988, the laws of this state shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development, all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state, subject only to the Constitution of the United States, and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this state.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"3. As used in this section, the term `unborn children' or `unborn child' shall include all unborn child <i>[sic]</i> or children or the offspring of human beings from the moment of conception until birth at every stage of biological development.</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"4. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as creating a cause of action against a woman for indirectly harming her unborn child by failing to properly care for herself or by failing to follow any particular program of prenatal care.\\\\\\\"</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  Judge Arnold dissented from this part of the Court of Appeals' decision, arguing that Missouri's declaration of when life begins should be upheld \\\\\\\"insofar as it relates to subjects other than abortion,\\\\\\\" such as \\\\\\\"creating causes of action against persons other than the mother\\\\\\\" for wrongful death or extending the protection of the criminal law to fetuses. 851 F. 2d, at 1085 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  Appellees also claim that the legislature's preamble violates the Missouri Constitution. Brief for Appellees 23-26. But the considerations discussed in the text make it equally inappropriate for a federal court to pass upon this claim before the state courts have interpreted the statute.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  The statute defines \\\\\\\"public employee\\\\\\\" to mean \\\\\\\"any person employed by this state or any agency or political subdivision thereof.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200(1) (1986). \\\\\\\"Public facility\\\\\\\" is defined as \\\\\\\"any public institution, public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof.\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200(2).</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  A different analysis might apply if a particular State had socialized medicine and all of its hospitals and physicians were publicly funded. This case might also be different if the State barred doctors who performed abortions in private facilities from the use of public facilities for any purpose. See <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297, 317, n. 19 (1980).</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  The suit in <i>Poelker</i> was brought by the plaintiff \\\\\\\"on her own behalf and on behalf of the entire class of pregnant women residents of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, desiring to utilize the personnel, facilities and services of the general public hospitals within the City of St. Louis for the termination of pregnancies.\\\\\\\" <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Poelker,</i> 497 F. 2d 1063, 1065 (CA8 1974).</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  In a separate opinion, Judge Arnold argued that Missouri's prohibition violated the First Amendment because it \\\\\\\"sharply discriminate[s] between kinds of speech on the basis of their viewpoint: a physician, for example, could discourage an abortion, or counsel against it, while in a public facility, but he or she could not encourage or counsel in favor of it.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d, at 1085.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  While the Court of Appeals did not address this issue, the District Court thought that the definition of \\\\\\\"public funds\\\\\\\" in Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200 (1986) \\\\\\\"certainly is broad enough to make `encouraging or counseling' unlawful for anyone who is paid from\\\\\\\" public funds as defined in \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200. 662 F. Supp. 407, 426 (WD Mo. 1987).</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  The Act's penalty provision provides that \\\\\\\"[a]ny person who contrary to the provisions of sections 188.010 to 188.085 knowingly performs . . . any abortion or knowingly fails to perform any action required by [these] sections . . . shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.075 (1986).</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  See Black's Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (\\\\\\\"Necessary. This word must be considered in the connection in which it is used, as it is a word susceptible of various meanings. It may import absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or it may import that which is only convenient, useful, appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the end sought\\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>[14]  The Court's subsequent cases have reflected this understanding. See <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 386 (1979) (emphasis added) (\\\\\\\"For both logical and biological reasons, we indicated in <i>[Roe]</i> that the State's interest in the potential life of the fetus reaches the compelling point at the stage of viability. Hence, <i>prior to viability, the State may not seek to further this interest by directly restricting a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy</i>\\\\\\\"); <i>id.,</i> at 389 (\\\\\\\"Viability is the critical point. And we have recognized no attempt to stretch the point of viability one way or the other\\\\\\\"); accord, <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 61 (State regulation designed to protect potential human life limited to period \\\\\\\"subsequent to viability\\\\\\\"); <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 428 (1983), quoting <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S., at 163 (emphasis added) (State's interest in protecting potential human life \\\\\\\"becomes compelling <i>only</i> at viability, the point at which the fetus `has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb' \\\\\\\").</p>\\\\n<p>[15]  For example, the Court has held that a State may require that certain information be given to a woman by a physician or his assistant, <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S., at 448, but that it may not require that such information be furnished to her only by the physician himself. <i>Id.,</i> at 449. Likewise, a State may require that abortions in the second trimester be performed in clinics, <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 462 U. S. 506 (1983), but it may not require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals. <i>Akron, supra,</i> at 437-439. We do not think these distinctions are of any constitutional import in view of our abandonment of the trimester framework. JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S claim, <i>post,</i> at 539-541, n. 1, that the State goes too far, even under <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977); <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519 (1977); and <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297 (1980), by refusing to permit the use of public facilities, as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200 (1986), for the performance of abortions is another example of the fine distinctions endemic in the <i>Roe</i> framework.</p>\\\\n<p>[*]  That question, compared with the question whether we should reconsider and reverse <i>Roe,</i> is hardly worth a footnote, but I think JUSTICE O'CONNOR answers that incorrectly as well. In <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113, 165-166 (1973), we said that \\\\\\\"the physician [has the right] to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention.\\\\\\\" We have subsequently made clear that it is also a matter of medical judgment when viability (one of those points) is reached. \\\\\\\"The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 64 (1976). Section 188.029 conflicts with the purpose and hence the fair import of this principle because it will sometimes require a physician to perform tests that he would not otherwise have performed to determine whether a fetus is viable. It is therefore a legislative imposition on the judgment of the physician, and one that increases the cost of an abortion.</p>\\\\n<p>[1]  Contrary to the Court, I do not see how the preamble, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205, realistically may be construed as \\\\\\\"abortion-neutral.\\\\\\\" It declares that \\\\\\\"[t]he life of each human being begins at conception\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"[u]nborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being.\\\\\\\" Mo. Rev. Stat. \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.1(1) and (2) (1986). By the preamble's specific terms, these declarations apply to all of Missouri's laws which, in turn, are to be interpreted to protect the rights of the unborn to the fullest extent possible under the Constitution of the United States and the decisions of this Court. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205.2. As the Court of Appeals concluded, the Missouri Legislature \\\\\\\"intended its abortion regulations to be understood against the backdrop of its theory of life.\\\\\\\" 851 F. 2d 1071, 1076 (CA8 1988). I note the United States' acknowledgment that this backdrop places \\\\\\\"a burden of uncertain scope on the performance of abortions by supplying a general principle that would fill in whatever interstices may be present in existing abortion precedents.\\\\\\\" Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> on behalf of appellants 8-9, n. 5.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>In my view, a State may not expand indefinitely the scope of its abortion regulations by creating interests in fetal life that are limited solely by reference to the decisional law of this Court. Such a statutory scheme, whose scope is dependent on the uncertain and disputed limits of our holdings, will have the unconstitutional effect of chilling the exercise of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy and of burdening the freedom of health professionals to provide abortion services. In this case, moreover, because the preamble defines fetal life as beginning upon \\\\\\\"the fertilization of the ovum of a female by a sperm of a male,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.015(3), the provision also unconstitutionally burdens the use of contraceptive devices, such as the IUD and the \\\\\\\"morning after\\\\\\\" pill, which may operate to prevent pregnancy only after conception as defined in the statute. See Brief for Association of Reproductive Health Professionals et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 30-39.</p>\\\\n<p>The Court upholds \\u00c2\\u00a7\\u00c2\\u00a7 188.210 and 188.215 on the ground that the constitutionality of these provisions follows from our holdings in <i>Maher</i> v. <i>Roe,</i> 432 U. S. 464 (1977), <i>Poelker</i> v. <i>Doe,</i> 432 U. S. 519 (1977), and <i>Harris</i> v. <i>McRae,</i> 448 U. S. 297 (1980). There were strong dissents in all those cases.</p>\\\\n<p>Whatever one may think of <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>Harris,</i> however, they most certainly do not control this case, where the State not only has withdrawn from the business of abortion, but has taken affirmative steps to assure that abortions are not performed by <i>private</i> physicians in <i>private</i> institutions. Specifically, by defining \\\\\\\"public facility\\\\\\\" as \\\\\\\"any public institution, public facility, public equipment, or any physical asset owned, leased, or controlled by this state or any agency or political subdivisions thereof,\\\\\\\" \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.200, the Missouri statute prohibits the performance of abortions in institutions that in all pertinent respects are private, yet are located on property owned, leased, or controlled by the government. Thus, under the statute, no abortion may be performed at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City \\u00c2\\u2014 where, in 1985, 97 percent of all Missouri hospital abortions at 16 weeks or later were performed \\u00c2\\u2014 even though the Center is a private hospital, staffed primarily by private doctors, and administered by a private corporation: the Center is located on ground leased from a political subdivision of the State.</p>\\\\n<p>The sweeping scope of Missouri's \\\\\\\"public facility\\\\\\\" provision sharply distinguishes this case from <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>Harris.</i> In one of those cases, it was said: \\\\\\\"The State may have made childbirth a more attractive alternative . . . but it . . . imposed no restriction on access to abortions that was not already there.\\\\\\\" <i>Maher,</i> 432 U. S., at 474. Missouri's public facility ban, by contrast, goes far beyond merely offering incentives in favor of childbirth (as in <i>Maher</i> and <i>Harris</i>), or a straightforward disassociation of state-owned institutions and personnel from abortion services (as in <i>Poelker</i>). Here, by defining as \\\\\\\"public\\\\\\\" every health-care institution with some connection to the State, no matter how attenuated, Missouri has brought to bear the full force of its economic power and control over essential facilities to discourage its citizens from exercising their constitutional rights, even where the State itself could never be understood as authorizing, supporting, or having any other positive association with the performance of an abortion. See R. Dworkin, The Great Abortion Case, New York Review of Books, June 29, 1989, p. 49.</p>\\\\n<p>The difference is critical. Even if the State may decline to subsidize or to participate in the exercise of a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, and even if a State may pursue its own abortion policies in distributing public benefits, it may not affirmatively constrict the availability of abortions by defining as \\\\\\\"public\\\\\\\" that which in all meaningful respects is private. With the certain knowledge that a substantial percentage of private health-care providers will fall under the public facility ban, see Brief for National Association of Public Hospitals as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10-11, Missouri does not \\\\\\\"leav[e] a pregnant woman with the same choices as if the State had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all,\\\\\\\" <i>ante,</i> at 509; rather, the public facility ban leaves the pregnant woman with far fewer choices, or, for those too sick or too poor to travel, perhaps no choice at all. This aggressive and shameful infringement on the right of women to obtain abortions in consultation with their chosen physicians, unsupported by any state interest, much less a compelling one, violates the command of <i>Roe.</i></p>\\\\n<p>Indeed, JUSTICE O'CONNOR appears to recognize the constitutional difficulties presented by Missouri's \\\\\\\"public facilities\\\\\\\" ban, and rejects respondents' \\\\\\\"facial\\\\\\\" challenge to the provisions on the ground that a facial challenge cannot succeed where, as here, at least some applications of the challenged law are constitutional. <i>Ante,</i> at 523-524. While I disagree with this approach, JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S writing explicitly leaves open the possibility that some applications of the public facilities\\\\\\\" ban may be unconstitutional, regardless of <i>Maher, Poelker,</i> and <i>Harris.</i></p>\\\\n<p>I concur in Part II-C of the Court's opinion, holding that respondents' challenge to \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.205 is moot, although I note that the constitutionality of this provision might become the subject of relitigation between these parties should the Supreme Court of Missouri adopt an interpretation of the provision that differs from the one accepted here. See <i>Deakins</i> v. <i>Monaghan,</i> 484 U. S. 193, 201, n. 5 (1988).</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  I consider irrefutable JUSTICE STEVENS' discussion of this interpretive point. See <i>post,</i> at 560-563.</p>\\\\n<p>[3]  The District Court found that \\\\\\\"the only method to evaluate [fetal] lung maturity is by amniocentesis,\\\\\\\" a procedure that \\\\\\\"imposes additional significant health risks for both the pregnant woman and the fetus.\\\\\\\" 662 F. Supp. 407, 422 (WD Mo. 1987). Yet the medical literature establishes that to require amniocentesis for all abortions after 20 weeks would be contrary to sound medical practice and, moreover, would be useless for the purpose of determining lung maturity until no earlier than between 28 and 30 weeks gestational age. <i>Ibid.;</i> see also Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 41. Thus, were \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 read to require a finding of lung maturity, it would require physicians to perform a highly intrusive procedure of risk that would yield no result relevant to the question of viability.</p>\\\\n<p>[4]  I also agree with the Court of Appeals, 851 F. 2d, at 1074-1075, that, as written, \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029 is contrary to this Court's decision in <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S. 379, 388-389 (1979).</p>\\\\n<p>[5]  The plurality never states precisely its construction of \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029. I base my synopsis of the plurality's views mainly on its assertion that the entire provision must be read in light of its requirement that the physician act only in accordance with reasonable professional judgment, and that the provision imposes no requirement that a physician perform irrelevant or dangerous tests. <i>Ante,</i> at 514-515. To the extent that the plurality may be reading the provision to require tests other than those that a doctor, exercising reasonable professional judgment, would deem necessary to a finding of viability, the provision bears no rational relation to a legitimate governmental interest, and cannot stand.</p>\\\\n<p>[6]  As convincingly demonstrated by JUSTICE O'CONNOR, <i>ante,</i> at 527-531, the cases cited by the plurality, are not to the contrary. As noted by the plurality, in both <i>Colautti</i> v. <i>Franklin,</i> 439 U. S., at 388-389, and <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976), we stressed that the determination of viability is a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician. But \\u00c2\\u00a7 188.029, at least as construed by the plurality, is consistent with this requirement. The provision does nothing to remove the determination of viability from the purview of the attending physician; it merely instructs the physician to make a finding of viability using tests to determine gestational age, weight, and lung maturity when such tests are feasible and medically appropriate.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>I also see no conflict with the Court's holding in <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416 (1983), that the State may not impose \\\\\\\"a heavy, <i>and unnecessary,</i> burden on women's access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure.\\\\\\\" <i>Id.,</i> at 438 (emphasis added). In <i>Akron,</i> we invalidated a city ordinance requiring that all second-trimester abortions be performed in acute-care hospitals on the ground that such a requirement was not medically necessary and would double the cost of abortions. <i>Id.,</i> at 434-439. By contrast, the viability determination at issue in this case (as read by the plurality), is necessary to the effectuation of the State's compelling interest in the potential human life of viable fetuses and applies not to all second-trimester abortions, but instead only to that small percentage of abortions performed on fetuses estimated to be of more than 20 weeks gestational age.</p>\\\\n<p>[7]  The plurality, ignoring all of the aforementioned cases except <i>Griswold,</i> responds that this case does not require consideration of the \\\\\\\"great issues\\\\\\\" underlying this case because <i>Griswold,</i> \\\\\\\"unlike <i>Roe,</i> did not purport to adopt a whole framework . . . to govern the cases in which the asserted liberty interest would apply.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 520. This distinction is highly ironic. The Court in <i>Roe</i> adopted the framework of which the plurality complains as a mechanism necessary to give effect both to the constitutional rights of the pregnant woman and to the State's significant interests in maternal health and potential life. Concededly, <i>Griswold</i> does not adopt a framework for determining the permissible scope of state regulation of contraception. The reason is simple: in <i>Griswold</i> (and <i>Eisenstadt</i>), the Court held that the challenged statute, regulating the use of medically safe contraception, did not properly serve <i>any</i> significant state interest. Accordingly, the Court had no occasion to fashion a framework to accommodate a State's interests in regulating contraception. Surely, the plurality is not suggesting that it would find <i>Roe</i> unobjectionable if the Court had forgone the framework and, as in the contraception decisions, had left the State with little or no regulatory authority. The plurality's focus on the framework is merely an excuse for avoiding the real issues embedded in this case and a mask for its hostility to the constitutional rights that <i>Roe</i> recognized.</p>\\\\n<p>[8]  The difference in the <i>Akron</i> and <i>Simopoulos</i> regulatory regimes is stark. The Court noted in <i>Akron</i> that the city ordinance requiring that all second-trimester abortions be performed in acute-care hospitals undoubtedly would have made the procurement of legal abortions difficult and often prohibitively expensive, thereby driving the performance of abortions back underground where they would not be subject to effective regulation. Such a requirement obviously did not further the city's asserted interest in maternal health. 462 U. S., at 420, n. 1. On the other hand, the Virginia law at issue in <i>Simopoulos,</i> by permitting the performance of abortions in licensed out-patient clinics as well as hospitals, did not similarly constrict the availability of legal abortions and, therefore, did not undermine its own stated purpose of protecting maternal health.</p>\\\\n<p>[9]  Notably, neither the plurality nor JUSTICE O'CONNOR advances the now-familiar catch-phrase criticism of the <i>Roe</i> framework that because the point of viability will recede with advances in medical technology, <i>Roe</i> \\\\\\\"is clearly on a collision course with itself.\\\\\\\" See <i>Akron,</i> 462 U. S., at 458 (dissenting opinion). This critique has no medical foundation. As the medical literature and the <i>amicus</i> briefs filed in this case conclusively demonstrate, \\\\\\\"there is an `anatomic threshold' for fetal viability of about 23-24 weeks of gestation.\\\\\\\" Brief for American Medical Association et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7. See also Brief for 167 Distinguished Scientists and Physicians, including 11 Nobel Laureates, as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-14. Prior to that time, the crucial organs are not sufficiently mature to provide the mutually sustaining functions that are prerequisite to extrauterine survival, or viability. Moreover, \\\\\\\"no technology exists to bridge the development gap between the three-day embryo culture and the 24th week of gestation.\\\\\\\" Fetal Extrauterine Survivability, Report to the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law 3 (1988). Nor does the medical community believe that the development of any such technology is possible in the foreseeable future. <i>Id.,</i> at 12. In other words, the threshold of fetal viability is, and will remain, no different from what it was at the time <i>Roe</i> was decided. Predictions to the contrary are pure science fiction. See Brief for A Group of American Law Professors as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 23-25.</p>\\\\n<p>[10]  Writing for the Court in <i>Akron,</i> Justice Powell observed the same phenomenon, though in hypothetical response to the dissent in that case: \\\\\\\"In sum, it appears that the dissent would uphold virtually any abortion regulation under a rational-basis test. It also appears that even where heightened scrutiny is deemed appropriate, the dissent would uphold virtually any abortion-inhibiting regulation because of the State's interest in preserving potential human life. . . . This analysis is wholly incompatible with the existence of the fundamental right recognized in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade.</i>\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 420-421, n. 1.</p>\\\\n<p>[11]  The plurality claims that its treatment of <i>Roe,</i> and a woman's right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy, \\\\\\\"hold[s] true the balance between that which the Constitution puts beyond the reach of the democratic process and that which it does not.\\\\\\\" <i>Ante,</i> at 521. This is unadulterated nonsense. The plurality's balance matches a lead weight (the State's allegedly compelling interest in fetal life as of the moment of conception) against a feather (a \\\\\\\"liberty interest\\\\\\\" of the pregnant woman that the plurality barely mentions, much less describes). The plurality's balance \\u00c2\\u2014 no balance at all \\u00c2\\u2014 places nothing, or virtually nothing, beyond the reach of the democratic process.\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA candidly argues that this is all for the best. <i>Ante,</i> at 532. I cannot agree. \\\\\\\"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property . . . may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\\\\\\\" <i>West Virginia Board of Education</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943). In a Nation that cherishes liberty, the ability of a woman to control the biological operation of her body and to determine with her responsible physician whether or not to carry a fetus to term must fall within that limited sphere of individual autonomy that lies beyond the will or the power of any transient majority. This Court stands as the ultimate guarantor of that zone of privacy, regardless of the bitter disputes to which our decisions may give rise. In <i>Roe,</i> and our numerous cases reaffirming <i>Roe,</i> we did no more than discharge our constitutional duty.</p>\\\\n<p>[12]  Cf. <i>South Carolina</i> v. <i>Gathers,</i> 490 U. S. 805, 824 (1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\\\\\\\"[T]he respect accorded prior decisions increases, rather than decreases, with their antiquity, as the society adjusts itself to their existence, and the surrounding law becomes premised on their validity\\\\\\\").\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>Moreover, as Justice Powell wrote for the Court in <i>Akron:</i> \\\\\\\"There are especially compelling reasons for adhering to <i>stare decisis</i> in applying the principles of <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i><i>.</i> That case was considered with special care. It was first argued during the 1971 Term, and reargued \\u00c2\\u2014 with extensive briefing \\u00c2\\u2014 the following Term. The decision was joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and six other Justices. Since <i>Roe</i> was decided in January 1973, the Court repeatedly and consistently has accepted and applied the basic principle that a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\\\\\" 462 U. S., at 420, n. 1. See, <i>e. g., </i><i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52 (1976); <i>Bellotti</i> v. <i>Baird,</i> 428 U.

It is true that \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205 is codified in Chapter 1, Laws in Force and Construction of Statutes, of Title I, Laws and Statutes, of the Missouri Revised Statutes, while all other provisions at issue are codified in Chapter 188, Regulation of Abortions, of Title XII, Public Health and Welfare. But because \\u00c2\\u00a7 1.205 appeared at the beginning of House Bill No. 1596, see <i>ante,</i> at 500-501, it is entirely appropriate to consider it as a preamble relevant to those regulations.</p>\\\\n<p>[2]  The testing provision states:\\\\n</p>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"188.029.

S. 113, 158, 162 (1973), established that the Constitution does not permit a State to adopt a theory of life that overrides a pregnant woman's rights. Accord, <i>Akron</i> v. <i>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,</i> 462 U. S. 416, 444 (1983). The constitutional violation is doubly grave if, as here, the only basis for the State's \\\\\\\"finding\\\\\\\" is nonsecular.</p>\\\\n<p>[13]  No Member of this Court has ever questioned the holding in <i>Roe,</i> 410 U. S., at 156-159, that a fetus is not a \\\\\\\"person\\\\\\\" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Even the dissenters in <i>Roe</i> implicitly endorsed that holding by arguing that state legislatures should decide whether to prohibit or to authorize abortions. See <i>id.,</i> at 177 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment did not \\\\\\\"withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter\\\\\\\"); <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton,</i> 410 U. S. 179, 222 (1973) (WHITE, J., dissenting jointly in <i>Doe</i> and <i>Roe</i>). By characterizing the basic question as \\\\\\\"a political issue,\\\\\\\" see <i>ante,</i> at 535 (concurring in part and concurring in judgment), JUSTICE SCALIA likewise implicitly accepts this holding.</p>\\\\n<p>[14]  \\\\\\\"The Court recognizes that the State may insist that the decision not be made without the benefit of medical advice. But since the most significant consequences of the decision are not medical in character, it would seem to me that the State may, with equal legitimacy, insist that the decision be made only after other appropriate counsel has been had as well. Whatever choice a pregnant young woman makes \\u00c2\\u2014 to marry, to abort, to bear her child out of wedlock \\u00c2\\u2014 the consequences of her decision may have a profound impact on her entire future life. A legislative determination that such a choice will be made more wisely in most cases if the advice and moral support of a parent play a part in the decisionmaking process is surely not irrational. Moreover, it is perfectly clear that the parental-consent requirement will necessarily involve a parent in the decisional process.\\\\\\\" <i>Planned Parenthood of Central Mo.</i> v. <i>Danforth,</i> 428 U. S., at 103 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\\\\n<p>[15]  The other examples cited by the State are statutes providing that unborn children are to be treated as though born within the lifetime of the decedent, see Uniform Probate Code \\u00c2\\u00a7 2-108 (1969), and statutes imposing criminal sanctions in the nature of manslaughter for the killing of a viable fetus or unborn quick child, see, <i>e. g.,</i> Ark. Stat. Ann. \\u00c2\\u00a7 41-2223 (1947). None of the cited statutes included any \\\\\\\"finding\\\\\\\" on the theological question of when life begins.</p>\\\\n<p>[16]  No fewer than 67 religious organizations submitted their views as <i>amici curiae</i> on either side of this case. <i>Amici</i> briefs on both sides, moreover, frankly discuss the relation between the abortion controversy and religion. See generally, <i>e. g.,</i> Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <i>Amicus Curiae,</i> Brief for Americans United for Separation of Church and State et al. as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> Brief for Catholics for a Free Choice et al. as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> Brief for Holy Orthodox Church as <i>Amicus Curiae,</i> Brief for Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod et al. as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> Brief for Missouri Catholic Conference as <i>Amicus Curiae.</i> Cf. Burke, Religion and Politics in the United States, in Movements and Issues in World Religions 243, 254-256 (C. Fu &amp; G. Spiegler eds. 1987).</p>\\\\n<p>[17]  \\\\\\\"Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of a broader concept of individual freedom of mind, so also the individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority. At one time it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all. This conclusion derives support not only from the interest in respecting the individual's freedom of conscience, but also from the conviction that religious beliefs worthy of respect are the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful, and from recognition of the fact that the political interest in forestalling intolerance extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects \\u00c2\\u2014 or even intolerance among `religions' \\u00c2\\u2014 to encompass intolerance of the disbeliever and the uncertain.
