Context: We are social science researchers studying how Roe v. Wade has been cited across different courts, times, and jurisdictions. We seek detailed yet consistent information from each case.
Format Requirements:
Answer each question in a new line under the corresponding number (or letter), without repeating the question.
For yes/no questions, answer only "yes" or "no" (all lowercase). If you cannot determine an answer, write "No information found."
When providing quotes/excerpts, limit them to 3–5 lines each.
If the requested information is not found or not applicable, write "No information found."
Level of Detail:
Include exact names, excerpts from the decision, and indicate whether statements appear in the majority, dissenting, or concurring opinions (if applicable).
Model Note:
Apply advanced reasoning to parse nuanced or implicit critiques of Roe v. Wade.
If the text is ambiguous, provide your best interpretation.
